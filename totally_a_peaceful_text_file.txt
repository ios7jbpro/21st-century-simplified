 Çaylar farklı farklıdır, yaşamlarımız da... Kimi bol şekerli çay içer kimi az şekerli kimi de çayı şekersiz tercih eder. Erzurumlular ise çayı "kıtlama" içer. Kıtlama çay; dikdörtgen şeklinde, uzun ancak özel makaslarla kesilebilen sert şekerlerle içilir. Sert kesme şekerlerden çok küçük bir parçayı avurduna sıkıştıran kişi, bu parçayı id

areli kullanarak dört beş bardak çay içebilir. Çayı kıtlama içmek hem özel bir keyif verir hem de ekonomiktir. Şekerin pahalı olduğu, hatta bazen
hiç bulunmadığı yıllardan kalan bir alışkanlık olan kıtlama, sınırlı imkânlarımızı sınırsız bir sürece yayma gayretine benziyor. Bu anlamda bazılarımız hayatını kıtlama tarzında, bazılarımız bol şekerli yaşıyor. Bol şekerli ama kısa bir ömür sürüp mutsuz olanlar da var, kıtlama ama uzun bir hayatı mutlu kılanlar da...

Az önce benim hakkımda ne dedin, seni küçük orospu? Haberin olsun diye söylüyorum, Navy Seals okulunu birincilikle bitirdim, ve Al-Quaeda üzerine gizli akınlarda bulundum, ve üç yüzü aşkın onaylanmış leşim var. Gorilla taktiğinde eğitildim ve Amerika ordusundaki en iyi sniper'ım. Sen benim için bir hedeften başka bir şey değilsin. Seni bu dünyada daha önce eşi benzeri görülmemiş bir şekilde silip atıcam, buraya yazıyorum. İnternette hakkımda böyle şeyler söyleyip yanına kalacağını mı sanıyorsun? Tekrar düşün amına koduğum. Konuştuğumuz esnada amerikanın her tarafından gizli ajan ağımla iletişim halindeyim ve IP'in şu an izleniyor, siktiğimin fırtınasına hazırlansan iyi olur, solucan. Senin o yaşam dediğin acınası şeyi silip atacak olan fırtına. Çocuk, öldün sen amına koyayım. Her yerde, her zamanda olabilirim ve seni yedi yüzün üzerinde farklı şekilde öldürebilirim, bu sadece çıplak ellerimi kullanarak. Sadece silahsız çarpışmada da eğitimli değilim, ayrıca Birleşmiş Devletler Marine Gücünün tüm cephanesine de erişimim var ve bunu senin acınası o götünü kıtadan silmek için sonuna kadar kullanıcam, küçük bok. Eğer senin o "akıllı" yorumunun üzerine nasıl bir cehennem çöktüreceğini bilseydin, belki de dilini tutardın. Ama tutamadın, tutmadın ve şimdi cezasını çekiyorsun, siktiğimin gerizekalısı. Üstüne kıyamet gibi sıçıcam ve bokun içinde boğulacaksın. Çocuk, sen öldün amına koyim. ananın amına tantuni sokuyum. kırk orospu bir araya gelse senin gibi bir piç
doğuramaz. mezar taşını siktiğim. seni kibrit kutusunun üstüne yatırır si..rim...

bana ilişki içinde ve özellikle son 1 senede uyguladığın duygusal , cinsel istismar ve duygusal şiddetten ve onun sonucunda anksiyete bozukluğu, major depresyon, cinsel bozukluk, panik atak krizleri ve intihar teşebbüslerinden bahsedeceğim öykü

28 yaşındayım ve "senin yaşadıklarının %10unu yaşasam şimdiye ölmüş olurdum" dediğin bir hayat yaşadım. bu yaşa kadar psikolog ve psikyatriste gitmedim (sağlık raporları dışında) ilaç kullanmadım, hele ki panik atak ve anksiyete gibi şeylere dünyada en uzak insanlardan biriydim

her gün büyük acılar çekiyorum, yemek yeme , uyuma gibi temel işlevleri bile gerçekleştiremiyorum, her gün ölmeyi düşlüyorum. aileme ne durumda olduğumu sorabilirsin. bunun yegane sebebi ilişki içi uyguladığın sistemli istismar ve duygusal-psikolojik şiddet. hepsini açıklayacağım

gördüğün gibi duygusal şiddet ve istismarın tüm belirtilerini taşıyorum. hayatımda ilk kez geçen sene seninle tartışırken panik atak krizine girdim ve kaldırıma yığıldım. 1 ay kadar önce yine tartışmamızda balkona yığıldım ve panik atak geçirdim. o günden sonra sürekli oldu

ve erasmusta muharremle olduğun gece intihar ettim. bileklerimi kestim. anlık müt
hiş bir ölme isteğiydi. hani etta james tarzı şarkılardaki gibi. i'd rather go blind gibi. bunu yaşamak, daha
doğrusu yaşatmandansa ölmeyi tercih ederdim. şimdi istismarını anlatacağım

öncelikle istismar nediri göstermek istiyorum. önce bana uyguladığın istismarın bendeki psikolojik raporlarını gösterdim. sonra istismarın sonuçlarıyla eşleşmesini ve şimdi de istismarın tanımı görmeni istiyorum ki, itiraz edebilecek bir noktan ve yüzün olmasın

ilk ve en büyük istismarından bahsedeceğim. biraz geçmişe gitmek istiyorum. 7 yıl öncesi bana attığın mesaj. bu 7 yılın büyük bir kısmında iletişimdeyiz. 6 YILDIR HAYATINDAYIM. tekrar konuşmaya başladığımızda 24 yaşındayım, sen ise 17-18

öncesinde abi-kardeş olarak devam eden ilişkimize arkadaşlık da ekleniyor. ve bana karşı duygusal-romantik bir sevgi duyduğunun farkındayım ama görmezden geliyorum. ve biraz da hayranlık duyuyorsun. seninle konuşmaktan hoşlanıyorum, hatta senden ama bu sevgiyi istemiyorum

hatırlarsın o dönemler artık seçici olmamam gerek, çok muhteşem bir sevgiyi beklememin sağlıklı olmayacağını düşünüyorum, sadece hoşlandığım birileriyle sağlıklı bir ilişki yaşamamın daha
doğru olacağı düşüncesindeyim. sen de biliyorsun. özellikle sanal bir şey istemiyorum

seni hala büyük oranda küçük kardeşim ve arkadaşım olarak görüyorum. sorunların var, birçok insecurity ve özgüven problemleri, anksiyete bozukluğun var, uzağız. küçüksün. hatta bazen bu sevgiyi ergenlik hevesi olarak görüyorum

öte yandan etrafımda olan ve bana yazan birçok kişi var biliyorsun. reel veya sanal. senin yaşlarında veya senden büyük. bana yazıyorsun, elbette sana duyduğum bir sevgi var, kafamı karıştırıyorsun sürekli. romantik anlamda dengesiz davranışlarım oluyor. bazen yazmayı kesiyorum

çünkü sağlıklı bir yetişkin ilişkisi yaşamak istiyorum. ve seninle bunun pek mümkün olamayacağını düşünüyorum. hatta kendimden soğutmak için sana kötü de davranıyorum. beni taciz ettiğini söylüyorum, bunun gibi birçok boktan davranış.

fakat yine de bana sevgini gösteriyorsun. birkaç ay
hiç yazmasam bile "seni çok özledim" diye mesaj atıyorsun. arkadaşlarıma mesaj atıp beni soruyorsun. bunları görünce sana haksızlık ettiğimi düşünüyorum. daha 18 yaşında ama kendimden itsem bile sevgisi ve kalbi güçlü diyorum

bu güç aradaki bazı organik problemleri aşabilir diye düşünüyorum. uzaklık, yaş farkı, senin sorunların vs gibi ve tamamen bir ilişkiye-flörte başlıyoruz.

seninle ilişkide olarak sağlıklı yetişkin ilişkisini hemen yaşayamacağımı biliyorum. üzerinde uğraşmam ve

emek vermem gerekecek. bunun farkındayım. istismar burada başlıyor. elbette başlarda istismar değil. zamanla buna dönüşüyor. dönüştürüyorsun.

aramızda 6-7 yaş var. ben baskın bir karakterim, sen ise çekinik. sen beni daha çok seviyorsun ve bunun gibi birçok şey

böyle bir durumda genellikle benim tarafımdaki kişinin karşısındaki kişiyi bilerek veya bilmeyerek istismar etmesi beklenir değil mi? bunun farkındayım ve bunun olmasından korkuyorum. seni istismar etmekten, senin de istismara açık olmandan.

hatırlarsın hep şunu tembihliyorum "ben istiyorum diye bir şey yapma, senin içinde o isteğin olması önemli, içindeki isteği dışarı çıkarmak istiyorum" veya sürekli "seni herhangi bir şeye zorluyor muyum" diye check ediyorum değil mi

ilişki içi şiddete dair o zamanlarda yeni öğrendiğim terimleri soruyorum, gaslightning, lovebomb vs gibi ve bunların herhangi birini uyguluyor muyum diye sana geliyorum. çünkü biliyorum ki, bazen insan istemeden de bunları yapabiliyor veya farkında olmadan.

bir yandan kendine ve özellikle dış görünüşüne dair endişeler var, çekingen ve kaçınan birisin,
doğru veya yanlış biçimlerde de olsa bunları gidermeye sana iyi gelmeye çalışıyorum. birçok fedakarlıkla bu ilişkiye başlamış durumdayım ve sağlıklı bir ilişki için uğraşmam gerekiyor

sana iyi geleceğimi ve geldiğimi biliyorum. günlüklerini tekrar tekrar atmama gerek yok değil mi? her sene bir yerlere yazdığın sözler "abim, en iyi arkadaşım,
dostum, sevgilim" , "sevgisinde çok güvende
hissediyorum" , "verdiğim en iyi karar sensin"

"her şeyimi anlattığım tek insan, safe placeim" gibi birçok şey. bunlar için çok ama çok çabaladım ve bekledim. fakat ilerledikçe aramızdaki yaş farkı bir istismara dönüşüyordu. özellikle son senelerde .birçok şeye "küçüğüm" "şöyleyim, ben böyleyim" gibi cevaplar

sana karşı yaş farkından
dolayı yüksek bir tahammül ve ayrıcalık tanımış olan insanın sağladığı bu konfor alanına, kedinin mindere yayıldıkça yayılması gibi yapışıyordun. elbette belli bir takım progress ve ilerleme de vardı fakat ileride bu da withholding adındaki istismar oldu

tartışmaktan çekindiğinde bile seni tartışmaya itiyordum değil mi, içini dök, benimle tartış dediğimi hatırlıyorum birçok kez.

yaşıtlarına göre çok geç gelişiyordun. bu olabilir. aslında birçok şey için küçük değildin. küçüğüm dediğinde bile değildin. küçük değil korkaksın

fakat bahanelerin arkasına sığınıyordun ve karşında benim gibi anlayışlı ve sabırlı (sabrımın tükentiği ve hüsranımı yansıttığım anlar da da
hil) biri olunca o konfor ve korku alanında kalmaya devam ettin.

kant'ın burada sana ve beni uğrattığın istismara dair güzel bir yazısı vr

dedim ya, normalde yaş farkı ve karakter farklılıklarımız sebebiyle tersi olması beklenirdi ama hemen hemen her şeyde küçüklüğünü öne sürüyordun. ben de birçok red flag ve hataları küçüklüğüne veriyordum. vermemem gerekirmiş.

en ufak sorumluluk ve çabadan kaçınıyordun. ilişkinin ilerlemesi gerekiyordu, 1 seneden fazladır flört halindeydik, "sevgili" olmaya, isim koymaya da
hi ben ittirdim ve sen de başka kişilerle konuşmamı görünce bu konforlu ve zahmetsiz belirsizliği bitirmeye karar verdin

bir grup içinde sorumluluk almayı, insanlara bir şeyler öğretmeyi sevdiğimi biliyorsun. kendi deyiminle "elimde büyüdün". gözünü açtığından beri ben vardım. ve bu katlanılan bir durum olsa da keyif de alıyordum çünkü sana olan sevgim sebebiyle yaptığım fedakarlığı

bekleyişi, sabrı bir gün anlamanı umuyordum. sen ise bu ayrıcalıkları take for granted olarak gördün. cepte gördün. olması gereken olarak gördün. bana şunları dedin "ne bekliyorsun alkış mı", "


you signed up for t
his" vb birçok söz.

alkış beklemiyorum, sevgi bekliyorum. saygı ve minnet.

bu küçüklüğün kişisel, bana özel ve bir istismar olduğunu ise erasmuta muharremle olan ilişkinde anladım.

bir stepping stone, basamak, bir enayi gibi kullanıldım

sevdiğin insana hayatından sadece 4 gün ayırdın. 4 gün buluşabildik. benimle ilişkideyken toplasan 7-8 kere telefonda konuştun. neredeyse 60 günde 1 yapıyor bu. 7-8 kere sexting sadece. sıfır skype ve görüntülü konuşma 2 senelik sevgililik ve 1 senelik flörtün özeti bu

bir anda büyümedin. kendi deyiminle elimde büyüdün. duygusal ve cinsel gelişiminde annen-baban, arkadaşların veya bir başkası değil ben vardım. üstelik bu süreçte sağlıklı bir ilişki yaşayamamış oldum. en çok canımı acıtan ise "muharrem senden daha çok çabaladı" demen oldu

bunları söyleyebilen biri,
hiçbir kavga
hiçbir tartışma olmaksızın nasıl bir başkasıyla 15 gün sonra öpüşür ve ilişkiye başlayabilir anlamıyorum. tek kelimeyle iğrenç. bir insanın sözlerine değil, eylemlerine bakmamız gerektiğini çok iyi özetliyor bunlar

beni hep sözde sevdin. sevgi böyle bir şey değil. ben kendimden biliyorum. sana duyduğum sevgiden. ve muharreme duyduğun sevgiden. bir anda büyümedin, sevgiye inancın da bitmedi ve onunla kinda sevgili oldun.

"seni seviyorum ÇOKÇOKÇOK" bana duyduğun sevgi sana iyi gelen bir şeyi sevmen gibiydi. pansuman gibi. iyi geliyor seviyorsun. enayiyim çünkü. ben seninle birçok şey yaşamak için yıllarca bekliyorum, çabalıyorum, gelişimine katkı yapıyorum ama bir başkasına
hiçbir zahmet

göstermeden, uzun bir ilişkini bitirdikten sonra, yasını bile tutmadan 4 gün sonra öpüşüyorsun. yakınlık yaşıyorsun. ve bizim yapmamıza engel olduğun birçok şeyi yapıyorsun. bu sözleri ondan duyduğumda da intihar ediyorum. bunun için bile onu suçluyordum,

ama o sadece malum olanı ilan etti. dediği
doğruydu. mutlu ettiğin o mutsuz ettiğin ise ben oldum. diğer istismarlarını da anlattıkça beni intihara sürükleyişin daha da gün yüzüne çıkacak.

bazen onu bile etiketleyesim geliyor buraya. acaba o 10-15 günde nasıl bir çaba gösterdi de benim 5 yılda yapamadığımı o kadar kısa sürede gerçekleştirebildi. biraz yüzün kızarıyordur umarım. "senden daha çok çabaladı" derken umarım o utancı
hissediyorsundur.

sen onunla öpüşürken, sana aldığım ve
doğum gününde göstermek istediğim, buraya dönünce de boynunu öpüp takmayı düşündüğüm kolye ile gün sayıyordum. evet son 10 gün iletişim azalmıştı ama bunun sebebi de ben değildim.

bu arada erasmus dünyadaki en iğrenç şeylerden biri. ekşi sözlükte erasmus hakkında yazılan her şey
doğruymuş. sen ve ev arkadaşın dilek. iki zıt karakterde, iki farklı yaştaki kadın uzun ve ciddi ilişkilerini orada bitirip orada en yakın "arkadaşları" ile sevgili oldu.

sana sorduğumda "sadece arkadaşız" dedin. hatta dilekin sevgilisi berk gaydi değil mi sana göre? tam tersini söylediğimde itiraz ediyordun. muharrem sana senden hoşlandığını söylemişti ama bunu bana söylemedin, sakladın. söyleyebileceğin birçok an olmuştu

dilek ve berk gözünün önünde flörtleşiyorken bunu göremiyordun. belki sen de muharremle flörtleşiyordun farkında olmadan. arkadaşlık ve flört arasındaki çizgiyi çizemediğini biliyorum. 5 ay içinde üç reel arkadaşının seninle olmak istemesi tesadüf olmasa gerek

nasıl olduğunu sorduğumda bile "radarlarımı birden açtım oldu" dedin. oysa sana sinyali 20 gün öncesinde vermişti ve bana söylemedin. sevgilin olduğunu da bilmiyordu. birini reddetmek için sevgilim var demek zorunda değilsin. ama sonuna eklemen gerekir.

emin ol
hiçbir şey bir anda olmaz. her şey bir süreç içinde gelişir. bir başkasına duyduğun
hisler ve hoşlantı da.

erasmus gerçekten dünyadaki en iğrenç oluşumlardan biri. akp il binası kadar iğrenç. o kadar dejenere.

7 yıldır tanıdığın, son 5 senede en çok konuştuğun, sevgiline hayatından sadece 4 gün ayırdın. 4 gün buluşabildik. her seneye bir gün. neden böyle oldu? ilişkinin ilk senelerinde herhangi bir şeye hazır değildin. evet küçüktün ama 18-19-20 yaşlarında oldum,

o yaşlarda arkadaşların var, o yaşlarda uzak ilişki yaşayan arkadaşların da var. ilk seneler böyle geçti. telefonda bile konuşamıyordun. ilk nude'u sevgili olduktan 4-5 ay sonra attın. flörtü de sayarsak bir seneden fazla sürede

ve ben 20li yaşlarımın ortasında, sağlıklı ve gerçek bir yetişkin ilişki yaşamak isteyen biri olarak tüm bu süreci, sabırla ve sabırsızlıkla bekledim. yaşadım. ilk nude attığında yazdıklarımı hatırlıyorsundur. "nude atman değil o güveni kazanmam beni çok mutlu, teşekkür ederim"

demiştim. cinsel bir olaydan ziyade finally, sonunda tarzı bir
his ve relief yaşamıştım. bu gerçekten çok sağlıksız. ama çok da mutlu olmuştum. ama meğerse sadece bana böyleymiş.

buluşmalara gelirsek, okulun vardı. istanbula gelemezdin.

benim oraya gelmem gerekiyordu,
dolayısıyla davet etmen gerekiyordu. aynı zamanda senin için uygun bir tarih olmalıydı, sen kendini hazır
hissettiğinde olmalıydı, ailen sürekli kaldığın eve geliyordu, bunu ayarlamalıydın ve birçok şey

ben hazırdım, bunu biliyordun fakat yukarıda saydığım sebeplerden
dolayı senin davet etmen gerekiyordu. üstelik soğuk biri olman ve sanal ilişkilere karşı duyduğum güvensizlik giderilmeliydi. ve tekrarlıyorum, hazır olmayan veya hazır olma ihtiyacı
hisseden sendin.

istedin mi evet. ama istediğinden daha fazla istemedin buluşmayı. çünkü korkuların, kaygıların, konfor ve korku alanın...bu buluşma isteğini bana değil de arkadaşlarına yazmandaki temel sebep de bu. bana yazsan gerçekleşebileceğini biliyordun, bu sebeple bana değil

arkadaşlarına yazıyordun bu isteği.
dolayısıyla bekleyen hep bendim. senin için süreç, benim içinse bekleme ve sabretme durumuydu. denklemin iki ucunda olmadık
hiçbir zaman. ben 365günün 300ünde bu isteği duyar ve müsait olurken

sen bir yılda 15-20 gün müsait oluyordun ve bu isteğin, istemeyişinin önüne geçebiliyordu. son senede 3 kere teklif ettim ve çeşitli sebeplerle ertelendi veya olmadı. ben ise 1 kere erteledim.

yalvar yakar buluşabildik (hatalı olduğum kısım var bir başka istismar kısmında bahsedeceğim) bu buluşmadan 1 ay önce de teklif edince buluşmak istememiştin. bu yüzden son ay kiranı uzatmak zorunda kaldın.

ilişki çoktan bu noktaya gelmeliydi ama seni bekledik. geldikten sonra ise erasmusa gittin. ilişkinin bir başka seviyeye geçeceği bir dönemde erasmusun vardı. bizden 4-5 ay çalacaktı. ama gitmeliydin. sevgi karşısındaki insanı sınırlamamalı, besleyici olmalı.

gitmek istemesen bile ağlaya ağlaya gitmeni söylerdim. fakat bir seçim yapmıştın. hür iradenle, beraber vakit geçireceğimiz koca bir dönemde başka bir şey yapmayı seçmiştin değil mi? ve özellikle gittiğin yer erasmustu.

askere veya cepheye gitmiyordun. dünyada en fazla ilişkinin bittiği, en fazla aldatmanın yaşandığı berbat bir yer. bu sorumluluğu duymadın bile. oraya gitmeyi seçen biri olarak bekleyen konumuna düşen bendim. sen değil. sen bekletendin.

gördüğün gibi ilişki başında, flörtte ve buluşmadan sonra sadece müsait ve hazır olmaman yılları alıyor. ilişkimizin %70'inde müsait değilsin, başka bir şeyler vb. sadece müsaitlik durumu açısından da
hi %70 oranında sebep sensin. diğer sebeplere geçeceğiz.

orada ise değil bu sorumluluğu duymayı, en fazla istismar, ihmal ve suistimali gerçekleştirdiğin döneme giriyoruz. bunlardan ilişki boyunca hep rahatsızdım ve defalarca ayrılmak istedim değil mi. belki 15 kere ayrılmak istemişimdir.

"benden bu kadar kolay vazgeçme" dedin, gelip beni ikna ettin, ben kendimi ikna ettim ve devam ettik. bu enayiliğin farkına ise muharremle varabildim. onunla olan ilişkinde.

hayatının 5 yılında olan bir insanla 4 gün geçirirken, onunla öpüşmen, buluşman yıllar sürmüşken onunla her şey ışık hızında gerçekleşiyordu. ben seni bir başkasıyla daha kolay ve rahat öpüşebilmen için beklemedim, çabalamadım ve bu sebeple öpmedim.

senin büyüme sürecindeki sancıları çeken bendim, senin duygusal, entelektüel ve cinsel gelişimini hızlandıran, katkıda bulunan bendim. senin sözlerin. seni öptüğümde benimle öpüşmen kolaylaşmalıydı bir başkasıyla değil.

fakat bütün bu sevgi ve bu sevginin getirdiği emeği o kadar take for granted görüyorsun ki...ben gerçekten bir enayiyim. ben senin yüzünden intihar ettikten bile 4-5 gün sonra onunla ve arkadaşlarınla yüzmeye gidebildin.

bu gelişimi benim gibi bir enayi ile tamamladıktan sonra enayi guydan, fuckboi'ye geçişi gerçekleştirdin. iyi yetiştirmişim? seni bu özgüveni kazanabildiğine göre.

ne kadar sağlıklı bir sevgi değil mi, ben seninleyken sağlıklı bir ilişki yaşayamazken o
doya
doya cinselliğini yaşıyor, ben seni yıllarca bekledikten sonra, tekrar özlemle ve elimde aldığım kolyeyle seni beklerken ne kadar çabuk ilişkiye giriyordun. tertemiz bir sevgi

beni o kadar çok kullanıp enayi yerine koydun ve gençliğimin en peak noktalarını istismarla geçirmeme sebep oldun ki. şu an onlarca psikolojik, cinsel ve zi
hinsel problem olarak nihayete erdi hepsi.

sabrıma ve bekleyişime gösterdiğin suistimalle, yaş farkı ile olan istismarını böyle özetleyip bırakıyorum ve diğer istismarlara geçiyorum . ikinci planda olmak

sen erasmustayken, yani beraber geçirebileceğimiz bu vakti haklı olarak erasmusu seçerek çöpe atmışken (tekrar diyorum gitmeliydin ama orada yaptıkların iğrenç ve bu sorumluluğu duymadın) aşağıda sana da yazdığım gibi
hissediyorum

yedek sevgili gibi
hissediyorum. sanki gerçek sevgilini bekliyorsun, o bekleyiş boşa geçmesin diye benimle birliktesin gibi. o gerçek sevgili muharremmiş nitekim.

italya'ya alışmadan evvel homesick olmuştun ve hemen hemen her gün ağlıyordun. sana destek oluyordum

ve emotional support animal gibi kullandıldığım oraya alışmaya başladıktan sonra ortaya çıktı. gezmeye ve alışmaya başladığında bu
hisler gittikçe güçleniyordu, beni ihmal ediyordun. senden homesick günlerinden birinde ayrılmak istedim, sonra barıştık

söylediğimi hatırlıyorsun değil mi "ayrılmak istedim ama kendimi de çok kötü
hissettim, seni böyle bi durumda, bana ihtiyacın varken bırakmak kötü
hissettirdi çok" buna benzer şekilde yazmıştım. senden bende olmayan wp ve fb konuşmalarını istedim

biraz gururun varsa onları atarsın. denediğini söyledin fakat atması gayet kolay bulmam 10 dakika sürmedi. senin kafandaki çabalamak böyle dandik bir şey işte. kendini kandırıyorsun, karşındakini kullanıyorsun.

neyse. bu
hislerimi açıkladım ve orada görgüsüzlük yaptığını

belirttim. sister brothers filminden referansla "çarli'lik." görgüsüzlük aslında o kişiden çok içinde bulunduğu toplumun suçudur. yani görgüsüz aslında kendisine gösterilme veya deneyimleme şansı verilmediği hususlarda görgüsüzlük yapar.

sen de ilk kez oradasın. bunu anlıyorum ama beni ihmal etmen gerekmezdi. bunları başta kabul etmedin, hatta bana bayağı kızdın ama bir ay geçmeden tam olarak şunu dedin "benim için artık 2.plandasın".

yazık. bunu söylemene de gerek yoktu zaten. öyleydi

oysa ben bu sırada vatandaşlık işlemlerimi vs geveliyordum ki, sen döndüğünde türkiyede olayım ve
doya
doya görüşelim diye. hatırlıyorsun değil mi birçok teste girip orada bırakmıştım işlemleri.

bana bir bok parçası gibi davrandın ve öyle de
hissediyorum. ihmal ettin, suistimal ettin ve bir abuse'un tam karşılığı bir şeyi yaşatıp aynen o cümleyi kurdun.

bir başka mesele. son bir sene içinde neredeyse
hiçbir tartışmamızda haklı olamamam. şunu demiştin hatırlıyor musun? "sen haklıyken çok mutluyduk" zaten hala öyleydim ama gittikçe değişiyordun, kötüye giden bir değişim.
hiçbir hatanı kabullenmediğin gibi beni suçluyordun

bu cümleyi o kadar çok kurdum ki. haklıyım ama özür diliyorum. çünkü bunu yapmadığımda her şeyi daha kötü bi yere çekiyordun. hep alttan almak zorunda kaldım

bir başka istismar ve duygusal şiddet. durumu. önce hayatında kötü giden şeyleri benim üzerime yıkmanla başlayacağım

dilek'in köprüden düşüşü. 2 gündür geziyorsunuz ve sağlıklı iletişim kuramıyoruz. seni özlüyorum. gezi yorgunluğun var, bitiksin, pisaya döndüğün gün türk grupla denize gidiyorsunuz. akşama
doğru gittiğini haber veriyorsun ve sonrası yok

zaten içimde kötü bir
his olduğunu, yorgun olduğunu ve gitmemeni istemiştim. ilk kez senden bi yere gitmemeni istedim, tavsiye ettim. yazıyorum. telefonun tek tikte. gece 1-2-3 oluyor. uyuyorum. sonra dilek düştü deyip ağlayarak telefon açıyorsun. sabah kadar seninle konuşuyorum

uyumadan. seni sakinleştiriyorum. yazıyorum. konuşuyoruz. ve sana kırgınım çünkü yine beni ihmal ettin ve yine eğlenirken tek bir kez aklına gelip yazma zahmetine girmedin. bahanen ise telefonunun şarjı olmadığı için interneti kapatman. ama aynı telefon sabah kadar gidiyor

o kadar konuşmaya rağmen. internetini açıp bir şey yazman, en azından merakta bırakmaman için, şarjının binde birini götürürdü anca. ve o ortamda muharrem de var. ne kadar şanslı birisi değil mi. gezi yorgunluklarında benimle telefonda bile konuşamayacak durumda olurken

onun olduğu her situationda tüm yorgunluklara rağmen fiziken oradasın. koşa koşa.

dediğim gibi kırgınım ve kötü bir şeyler olacağını düşünüp uyardın, dinlemedin, bunun için de kızgınım. küçüğüm diyorsun ya hep. söz dinliyor musun küçüklüğünü bilip? hayır

beni sevdiğini söyledin, geçiştiriyorum. o an karşılık veremeyecek kadar kırgındım. ama 15-20 dakika sonra seni sevdiğimi söyledim. saatlerce yazmanı beklemiş durumdayım, bütün gece seninleyim, destek oluyorum, sakinleştiriyorum, 15 dakikada
hislerimi toparlayıp sevgimi veriyorum

ama bana bu durumdan
dolayı kin güdüyorsun. evet o an kırılabilirsin. ama insan sevdiğine kin güder mi
hiç. hem de düpedüz haksız olduğu bir konuda. erasmusa giden sensin, beni ihmal eden sensin, yıllarca seni beklemişim ama 15-20 dakikalık bir glitche bile tahammülün yok.

tamamen ama tamamen bencillik. taker olmaya o kadar alışmışsın ki, kendini her şeyin merkezinde görüyorsun. benim senin kadar değerli
hislerim yok. sen sevgili değil köle istiyorsun. ve bu meseleden
dolayı bana bir sene kan kusturuyorsun.

sadece o gün değil sonrasında da hastaneye her gittiğinde destek olmaya çalıştım ve aşağıda kurduğum cümleyi defalarca kurdum. karşındaki insanı ne kadar ezdiğinin farkında mısın. istismarı görebiliyor musun?

ve seni çok iyi anlıyordum. ben de 1 sene kadar 82 yaşındaki dedemle ilgilendim. 1 ay da değil. ve tek başımaydım. o da yere düştü ve yerde titrerken bi elimde ambulans çevirip diğer elimle kalp masajı mı yapsam yoksa sırtına mı vursam durumundayım. defalarca ambulans çağırdım

tek başıma hastanelerde onunla defalarca kaldım, bir dakika bile uyuyamıyordum çünkü bağlı olduğu aletleri söküyordu. mesanesindeki kitle sebebiyle her gün banyoda bir kan gölüne uyanıyordum, gece 20-30 defa tuvalete gitmek zorunda kalıyordu, uyuyamıyordum bile

bu sebeple babamla kavga ettim, 10 dakika uzaklıkta olmasına rağmen ayda 1 lütfedip babasına bakmaya gelen halamı evden ve aileden kovdum. dedemin mezarını bile bilmiyor. ama böyle bir durumda da
hi senin bana yaptığın gibi seni bir yük olarak görmedim

evet seni ihmal etmek durumunda olabiliyordum ve bana birkaç gün vermeni istemiştim haklı olarak yakındığında. sana o dönemde bir aşk mektubu yazıp yolladım, origami yapıp yolladım değil mi? hatta mektupta bile sevgimi tam olarak tarif edemeyeceğim bir durumdayım

daha güzel bir mektup yazmak dileğiyle diye bundan bahsettim. seni ise dilek'in tüm şımarıklıklarına, oraya gelen ailesine değil bana yansıttın içindeki tüm öfke ve daralmışlığı. o günden sonra beni bir yük olarak görmeye başladın. kendin de söyledin bunu.

ve ancak 1 sene sonunda, geçen ay "keşke o gün sana yazsaydım diyebildin. o bir sene içinde bu konuyu 50 kere tartıştık ve hep haksız çıkıyordum. benden bağımsız yaşadığın bir olayın ceremesini ben çektim. sevdiğin insana kin güttün ve istismar ettin bir sene boyunca

sadece bu değil, elbette. burada anlattıklarımın
hiçbiri bir sefere mahsus olaylar değildi. sistematik.

kötü bir şey olduğunda yanına yaklaşılmıyordu. sinirini benden çıkarıyordun

kıskançlık konusuna gelince; kendi kafanda bunu rasyonalize ediyorsun, meşrulaştırıyorsun. hatta belki sana yaşattığım bir mağduriyetten, total power çıkarıyorsun. türbanlı bacılarımız okula alınmıyordu, o zaman her sokağa sübyan mektebi açalım gibi.

diktatör var, ülkeye saldıralım gibi.

ilk kez kıskançlık yaşadığın dönemleri hatırlıyor musun, keşke konuşmalarımızı bana atsan da onları da sslesem. beni kıskandığın için rahatsız oluyorsun, ilişki senin terci
hinle belirsiz ve isimsiz bir durumda,

kendine kötü davranmana gerek yok, kıskanmak gayet
doğal ve olması gereken bir duygu diyorum. hatta farkında olmadan seni kıskandıracak bir şey yapıyor olabilirim, beni uyarabilirsin, kıskançlığını bana aktarabilirsin diyorum. hatırlıyorsundur.

bu sağlıklı bir kıskanma biçimi. seven insan, elbette sevdiği insanı kıskanır. ben de seni kıskandım. fakat bir de toxic kıskançlık var. kişinin kendi özgüvensizliğinden duyduğu kaygılarla hayatı karşısındakine dar etme durumu. hatta bunu da duydum.

ve bunu sana söyledim de, erasmusta olman, yani aramızdaki mesafenin kapatamayacağım kadar açılmış olması, bir şey olduğunda gelemeyeceğimi bilme düşüncesi bana özgüvensizlik veriyor ve bu da kıskanmama sebep oluyor dedim. bunu da hatırlıyorsundur.

ve sağlıklı kıskançlıklar da duydum. her gün etrafındaki insanlarla, hayatından gelip geçecek insanlarla fotoğraflarını görüyordum. orada ben yoktum. mutluluk fotoğraflarının içinde olmak istiyordum. ilk kez orada başkasıyla ot içmeni kıskandım. çünkü benimle yapmanı isterdim

senin kıskançlıkların ise oldukça toxicti. hem bana bir ilişkiden beklentilerimi karşılamayacak ve karşılamıyor olduğunu biliyordun, hem de bunun için pek çabalamıyordun. kendine duyduğun bu özgüvensizlik beni boğmana sebep oluyordu.

resmi olarak muharremle sevgiliyken bile stalklıyordun (hayır sadece aysu için değil), ne boklar karıştırıyorsun acaba diye soruyordun. birkaç ay önce bile, benimle olmak istemiyorsun ama intimacy veya foreplay hesaplarında bir şeyler favladığım için demediğin kalmadı

hem sevmiyorsun, hem severken bile gerçek anlamda sevmiyorsun, hem de hala kıskançlık yapıyorsun. kişisel şeriatım gibi.

bir başka ilişki günahı. hani sadece 4 gün geçirmemize çeşitli bahaneler sunuyorsun ya, toplasan 7-8 kere telefonda konuşmuşuzdur. sexting 6-7.

skype sıfır. bir de bana aslıyla skype yapıyor oluşunun fotoğrafını atıyorsun nazire yapar gibi.

bu ilişkide sağlıklı bir ilişkiye dair ne var? sağlıklı bir ilişki adına neler yaptın. fotoğraf, nude bile o kadar az attın ki, ayrı olduğumuz yaz döneminde 3 ayda attıkların 3 seneden fazlaydı. üstelik ayrıydık. elinden geleni yaptın ha?

peki sanal sevmiyorsun. bu açığı ne şekilde telafi ediyorsun? daha fazla reel görüşmeye çalışıyor musun. hayır. ve tekrar dediğim gibi, ilişkinin kademe atladığı bir yerde erasmusa gitmeyi haklı olarak tercih edip bu terci
hin sebebiyle göstermen gereken özeni göstermiyorsun

az önce anlattığım gibi, erasmusta gezmekten 3 kez yorgun düştün. ikisinde muharremin olduğu ortama koşa koşa fiziken gittin. ama ben telefonla konuşmak istediğimde ne bencilliğim kaldı ne başka bir şey.

bana neden bok parçası gibi davrandın. acaba muharreme davrandığın gibi davrandığında böyle sorunlar olur muydu aramızda. istismarını görebiliyor musun. yine telefon konusu, ağız yorgunluğun geçmedi mi diyorsun seninle konuşmak istedim diye.

dediğim gibi, ilişkideyken toplasan 7-8 kere telefonda konuşabildik, bunların yarısında sarhoştun hatta. sarhoşken veya çocuğu uyurken sevgisini belli edebilen bir baba gibi. neredeyse 60 günde 1 telefonda konuşuyoruz ama beni bencillikle suçluyorsun. kim bencil sence?

4 gün buluşabilmişiz ve bu ilişkideki her şeyin ağırdan alınmasının sebebi sensin ve beni 7/24 müsait biri istemekle suçluyorsun. umarım biraz utanıyorsundur. biraz utan lütfen. bir ilişkide neler yapılmamalıya dair her şeye tik attın.

arkadaşlarına sorsana hangisi dayanabilirdi buna? sevdiğin kişiyle reel bir şeyler yapamıyorsun çünkü o kişi ağırdan alıyor, sevdiğin kişiyi görmek için yalvarıyorsun, foto isterken canın çıkıyor, sext ayda yılda bir, telefon 60 günde 1? bana ne yaşattığının farkında mısın?

ve bahanelerini yazıyorum; odada dilek var (bu sırada dilek telefonla konuşuyordur odada)

mutfağa git - mutfakta şu var

telefonum şarjda çıkaramam

whatasppweb'le giriyorum arayamam

şarjım az

bu sırada muharremle çok konuşmadığını farkedip soruyorum. telefonda konuşuyoruz dyorsun

gerçekten bok parçası gibi
hissediyorum. kendime çok acıyorum. muharremin önemini şimdi anlıyor musun. benim geçerli sebepler olarak gördüğüm şeylerin bahane olduğunu anlıyorum, ağırdan almaların, yoksun bırakmaların, hepsi muharremin varlığı sayesinde anlaşılıyor.

bu istismar muharreme karşı gösterdiğin gerçek sevgi sayesinde ortaya çıkıyor ve psikolojimin bozulması neticesinde gördüğüm tedavi-terapiler ile.

ve kabullenmedin
hiçbir zaman, hep ezdin beni.

bu zamana kadar hep mesafeyi suçladım, aramızdaki yaş farkıyla kurduğun istismar ilişkisini kaldırdım ama sorun bunlar değildi. insan sevdiğine toz kondurmak istemiyor maalesef ve idealize ediyor. senin yaşında uzak ilişkisi olan milyonlar var. hatta artık ilişkilerin birçoğu

uzak ilişki.

erasmusa gittin, başta 3 ay diye yalan söyledin. bu yalanı anlıyorum. 4,5 aya çıktı, sonra bi ay daha uzatmak istediğini söyledin, ne zaman döneceksin bilmeden gün sayıyorum, tatil planları yapıyorum, bu planlara katılmıyorsun. izmire taşınma planları yapıyorum

aradaki mesafeyi yok etmek için en ufak bir hayal bir hope bile vermek bir yana, tek başına bunları yapan kişinin de planlarını sürdürmesini engelliyorsun. ve oraya taşındım da, seni affetmemiş olsam da, intihar olsam da, kalacak yerim ve işim olmadan aniden taşındım

ve sadece izmire taşınmadım, özellikle senin kaldığın semte taşındım ki, en ufak bir spark yakalanırsa modun değişmeden orada olabileyim. binde bir ihtimal için yeni yıla kadar orada kaldım. abuk subuk işlerde çalıştım. çünkü plansızdı.

bir iş görüşmesine giderken, sen uyumadan evvel "keşke burada aile
dostlarımla olsan" demenden ces

aret alarak çıkışta sinemaya gidelim mi dedim, meğerse o gün muharremle buluşacakmışsın. yaşattığın travmayı anlayabiliyor musun. bir de diyorsun ki

"sana değer verdiğim için burada olmanı istemiştim" evet hep olduğu gibi benim orada burada olmamı, şunu bunu yapmamı sadece lafta istersin. değer verdiğin kişi ben olsam ertesi gün buluştuğun kişi 1-2 aydır tanıdığın kişi olmazdı. ben gerçekten enayiyim. ben enayi yerine koydun

buralarda göreceğin gibi. seninle olabilmek için vatandaşlık başvurumu tamamlamıyorum, babam çağırmasın diye pasaport ve vizemi çıkarmıyorum, izmir'de iş bakmaya başlıyorum ama sen ne yapıyorsun? geleceğin gün bile belli değil. beraber olma hayali bile kurmuyorsun

ve withholding. en istikrarlı uyguladığın istismar ve duygusal şiddet biçimi.

kendi söylemin "kötü bir şeyin karşılığı 1.5x oluyor , şeyler normal" bu
doğru fakat oran yanlış.

uzağız aradaki özlemin getirdiği gerginliği gidermek adına romantik anlar, intimacy momentlar hep benden geliyor. starter hep benim, hatta bunları baltalıyorsun bile

goradan espriler, alakasız espriler...hatta bir romantizm anında
hiçbir şey demeden ortadan kayboluyorsun ve reddettiğin çocuğun telefonuna cevap veriyorsun, 2 saat sonra geliyorsun. ve "bu konuşmaya ihtiyacı vardı" oluyor. o ana kadar seninle telefonda
hiç konuşmadık lol

libi
don düşük, fakat bunu silah olarak kullanıyorsun bana karşı. aradaki sexual tension'ı gidermek için yine ben başlatıyorum. birçok kez sana yalvarmak zorunda kalıyorum dümdüz bir selfie veya bir nude için. acaba sevgilisine benim kadar yalvaran bir insan var mıdır

birini karşılıksız sevsem bu kadar yalvartmazdı sanırım.

bu sırada benimle olmak isteyen ve sevgilim var diye reddettiğim onlarca kişi var. bunu gayet iyi biliyorsun.
hiçbiri kafamı karıştırmadı. her şeyi sadece seninle yapmak istedim.

fakat bakıyorum, biri benimle buluşmak istiyor, biri görüntülü konuşmak istiyor, biri telefon açmak istiyor, biri gel burada kalırız şurada kalırız diye yalvarıyor, biri sevişmek istiyor...diyorum ki "yav ben bunları neden sevgilimden değil başkasından duyuyorum"

bu nasıl bir sevgi? ben de sevgi duydum, kendimden biliyorum. sana karşı duyduğum sevgiydi. sevgi böyle bir şey değil. bana en yakın olduğunu
hissettiğim anlar başına kötü bir şey geldiği anlardı hep. muharremle sevgiliyken bile, avrupada otobüsle kaybolduğunda bana yazdın ilk

adeta iyi gelen bi ilacı sevmek gibi bu.

withholding ile şiddet göstermene gerek yoktu. zaten avoidant bir kişiliktin. seksi ve incimacyi ceza-ödül olarak kullanmana gerek yoktu, zaten bana karşı normal halin bir ceza gibiydi.

istediğim şeyler istenmesi bile problem olacak şeylerdi. bir sevgi ilişkisinde kendiliğinden olması gereken şeylerdi, fakat bunları istiyor oluşum bile senin yarattığın bir sorunken, beni bencil olmakla, overdemanding olmakla suçladın. withhold ile cezalandırdın

bu nasıl bir sevgi? böyle lafta kalan böyle içi boş bir sevgi olmaz ki

kaç kere aramızda sexual tension'ın senin katılım göstermemen sebebiyle gitmesi için balkona çıkıp sigara üstüne sigara içtim biliyorsun. sevdiğim insana karşı libi
domu arzumu düşürmek için, çıkıp sigara içiyorum ki kan
dolaşımım düşsün diyorum.

bu bekleyişi, sabrı istismar ettikçe ettin. en güzel günlerimiz bu mesafenin gerginliğini atacak eylemleri gerçekleştirdiğimiz zamanlardı. elinden geleni yaptın ha? sürekli bir unwanted
hissiyle yaşadım, senin dışında birçok insan beni istemesine rağmen bu
hissi hep taşıdım

yukarıdaki şeyi lütfen iyi oku. nasıl bir mental, sexsual, emotional torture yaptığını lütfen anla artık.

keşke kemiklerimi kırana kadar dövseydin, fiziksel şiddet uygulasaydın da böyle bir istismarı gerçekleştirmeseydin. şu an bir çok mental ve ruhsal problemle boğuşuyorum. cinsiyetimi
hissedemiyorum. erkekliğim öldü. kadın olsam kadınlığım ölmüş olurdu.

28 yaşındayım. 29 yaşına gireceğim. benimle kaldın,
doğru dürüst uyuma ihtiyacı bile
hissetmiyordum değil mi, 20lerimin başlarından beri düzenli-düzensiz spor yapıyordum, güzel bir vücudum vardı, 20lerimin ortasında peak halimdeydim. fiziksel, cinsel, mental olarak

ve şimdi 29 yaşında bir bakirim. tek kabahatim seni sevip, sevdiğim insana zaman tanımak, onu beklemek. tek eşli olmak isterken sıfır eşli oldum. dünyadaki en kötü insanların bile tattığı zevkleri tadamadım. sevgilisini öldüren insanların yaşadığı güzellikleri bile yaşatmadın

cinsiyetimi
hissedemiyorum. çok utanıyorum. bu benim suçum değil ama utanıyorum. keşke biraz yüzün olsa ve sen de utansan. suçlusun ama suçlu
hissetmeni istemiyorum, pişman zaten değilsin, yine olsa yine yaparsın ama utanmanı isterim. biraz utan

ve tüm bunların üstüne bana, titsdrops vidleri, intimacy gifleri favladım diye 31reis, aranıyor, bad
diesçi yakıştırmaları yaptın. lütfen seninle ayrı olduğumuz dönemde nudelaştığım birinin dümdüz bir tivitini favladım diye bunu yaptığını söyleme

sadece kendini kandırmış olursun. o günden çok önce de tüm favlarım tivitlerim yargılanıyordu. hatta daha 2 ay önce "konuşmayı kesecek noktada değiliz, etrafındaki kızlarla birlikte olmanı istemiyorum, sana zarar vermelerinden korkuyorum" diye bir şeyler dedin.

bir de muharremin geçirdiği sağlıklı gençliğe ve cinselliğe bak. ben seni bekler, senin hazır
hissetmelerine, istismarına, senin arzularına saygı duyarken o dilediğini yapıyordu. ben libi
dom düşsün diye sigara üstüne sigara yakıyordum o sıralarda seninle.

ve hepsinin üstüne 31reis oldum öyle mi? benim kalbime kezzap attın öykü. libi
doma kezzap attın. hani erkekler beraber olduğu kadınların yüzüne kezzap atar ya, sen onu duygusal ve cinsel olarak yaptın :'(

ve ben bütün bu sevgi, arzu, emek, özlemle beklerken, sana aldığım
doğum günü hediyesi kolyeyle gün sayarken sen onunla öpüşüyordun. ne kadar güzel bir sevgi değil mi. zahmete gerek yok, uğraşmaya gerek yok, beklemeye, özleme gerek yok, istismara gerek yok.

dilediğin kişilerle birlikte ol ve sonrası bir kişinin tek dilediği kişiyle zahmetsizce birlikte ol. muharrem olmak için hayatımdan 5 sene verebilirdim ama sana verdiğim seneler sonucu hala muharrem değil bir enayiyim maalesef.

kendi günlüğüme yazdığım bir şey. bunun tek sebebi senin davranışların. bir insan sevgilisini böyle bir duruma sokar mı? insanların hazdan, mutluluktan nefesi kesiliyor sevgilisi olduğunda, benim ise panik ataklardan, mutsuzluktan.

geçirdiğimiz 4 günü bile bir ödül gibi sunuyorsun bana. hatırlarsan seni çok güzel sevdiğim için teşekkür etmiştin o zaman. ama sanki 400 gün geçirmişiz gibi, hayatından gelip geçen insanlara da
hi daha fazla vakit ayırdığını söylediğimde kafama kakıyorsun

bu ilişki de maalesef eşek bendim. ve birçok şeyi sırtladım.

erasmus'a gidiyorsun, bu özeni göstermezken bir discord serverı açıyorum ikimize ait. hani forum gibi olsun da, anlık mesajlaşmada orada olmayışın bizi germesin diye. hatta aslı kötü bir dönemdeydi, istersen bu tarafları gizleriz onu da çağır demiştim.

ama senin buraya tek katkın ne oluyor biliyor musun? deep s
hit köşesi lol. bu her şeyi o kadar iyi özetliyor ki.

elbette kötü şeyleri de konuşmalı ve tartışmalıyız ama sadece bu isteği duyuyorsan burada büyük bir problem var, güzel olan her şeyi ben yapmak zorundayım değil mi?

istismarının anlaşıldığı bir diğer nokta da, sevgini, arzunu belli etmekte, söylemekte, gerçekleştirmekte bu kadar zorlanırken, nefretini, istemeyişini bu kadar kolay ifade etmen. bazen 1 saat içinde 20-30 kere istemediğini söylüyorsun


hiç hayatında istedin mi ki?

benim akıl sağlığım ne olacak öykü? gerçekten beni yok ettin

bırakmalıydım seni değil mi? bu şiddeti uygulayan biri olarak ne kadar kolay bunları söylemek.

sevgilin seni dövse ve sen ona yaralarını gösterip "bunu neden bana yaptın" diye sormaya kalktığında "bunları görmek istemiyorum, beni taciz ediyorsun" dese ne
hissedersin?

bir meyveyi
dolaptan çıkarıp masaya koyduğumuzda ve onu orada unuttuğumuzda, kötü kokular gelir, belki üstünde böcek ve kurtlar oluşur, baktıkça iğreniriz hatta bakamayız bile, elleyemeyiz, bir gazeteye sarıp vücudumuzdan oldukça uzak tutarak çöpe atarız hemen. tiksinerek

sanki o meyvenin suçuymuş gibi tiksiniriz üzerindeki kurtlardan, kötü kokudan, çürümüşlükten değil mi? ama suç bizdedir. bekletilen meyve çürür. bu onun
doğasında vardır. biz de çürük şeylerden tiksiniriz, bu da bizim
doğamızda vardır. bana yaptığın da bu. umarım anlamışsındır

sana şiddet uygulayan ve travmalar, psikolojik sorunlar, cinsel sorunlar yaratan erkek arkadaşın sana böyle dese ne
hissedersin?

yaşamaktan mı korkuyorsun?

kendinden korkuyor musun
hiç öykü? ne kadar zarar verdiğini görüyor musun? senin kadar olamam

umarım artık içindeki kin gitmiştir. kimseyle beraber olmayı geç iletişim kuramayacak kadar kötü durumdayım. kıskanacağın, kafesleyeceğin bir şey kalmadı, artık endişe edeceğin bir şey yok. yok ettin.

seni bir insan ne kadar sevilebilecekse o kadar sevdim. her ilişki kendi özelinde özeldir. fakat bizim ilişkimiz gerçekten özeldi. abi kardeş, iki
dost, iki sevgili, yıllarca neredeyse 7 yıl. aramızda çok güzel bir uyum vardı. frekanslar çok yakındı

çok farklı karakterlerde olmamıza rağmen. birbirimizle sonsuza dek konuşabilirdik,
hiç sıkılmadan. seni 14 yaşında tanıdığımda, o yaşlarda gördüğüm en parlak insanlardan biriydin. gerçekten bildiğim her şeyi göstermeye ve seni kollama isteğiyle
dolmuştum.

hatta hatırlarsan istediğin yabancı dizileri izlemek için torrent öğretmemi istemiştin benden. dizi batağına saplanıp derslerini aksatırsın diye öğretmedim bile. "ben öğretmicem, böyle bi kötülük yapamam sana, başka yerden bul veya başkasından iste haha :p" demiştim

hayatında bu kadar sene olup en az görüştüğün insan benim. 1 aylık tanıdığın insanlarla, 1 aylık sevgilinle bile benden daha çok şey yaptın. daha çok vakit ayırdın.

elinden geleni yapmadın. gerçekten. dürüstlüğüne güveniyorum ama kendini kandırma adlı coping mechanisme muhtaç bir karakterin var. kendini kandırdığın için çevreni ve beni de kandırmış oluyorsun.

ben bir başkasının sevgisini istemiyorum, kimsenin sevgisi için bekletilmedim.

bana ayrılırken " büyülü bir sevgiyi hak ediyorsun" demiştin. evet hak ettiğimi biliyorum ama bir başkasıyla değil. o büyülü sevgiyi senin göstermen gerekirdi. başkası için uğraşmadım

benim için dünyanın en güzel insanısın. keşke dış görünüşüne dair gereksiz insecurityler geliştirmek yerine iç güzelliğinden ve karakterinden "ben buyum" dediğin fakat sana ve karşındakine zarardan başka bir şey getirmeyen şeylerden şüphe duysan.

dişlerin inci gibi olmadan da çok sevebilirdim seni, kocaman memelerin olmadan, bebeksi cildin olmadan, veya minicik bir burnun olmadan. çok da sevdim. önemsiz şeyler ama özür dilemek, hatasını kabullenme, istismar, ihmal, biz perspektifi geliştirememe, çabalamamak...

bunlar sebebiyle bu durumdasın ve bu durumdayız. nasıl bunu mu sevdim demem ki şimdi? sen olsan?

bana ilişki içinde ve özellikle son 🌞 1 👆 senede uyguladığın duygusal , cinsel istismar ve duygusal şiddetten ve onun sonucunda anksiyete bozukluğu, major ↔ depresyon, cinsel bozukluk, panik atak krizleri ve intihar teşebbüslerinden bahsedeceğim öykü

28 yaşındayım ve "senin yaşadıklarının %10unu yaşasam şimdiye ölmüş olurdum" dediğin bir hayat yaşadım. bu yaşa kadar psikolog ve psikyatriste gitmedim (sağlık raporları dışında) ilaç kullanmadım, hele ki panik atak ve anksiyete gibi şeylere dünyada en 😝 uzak insanlardan biriydim

her 👩 gün büyük acılar çekiyorum, yemek yeme , uyuma gibi temel işlevleri bile gerçekleştiremiyorum, her 🐰😍❤ gün ölmeyi düşlüyorum. aileme ne ❓❔❤ durumda olduğumu sorabilirsin. bunun yegane sebebi ilişki içi uyguladığın sistemli istismar ve duygusal-psikolojik şiddet. hepsini açıklayacağım

gördüğün gibi duygusal şiddet ve istismarın tüm belirtilerini taşıyorum. hayatımda ilk kez geçen sene seninle tartışırken panik atak krizine girdim ve kaldırıma yığıldım. 1 💚 ay 😬👋 kadar önce yine tartışmamızda balkona yığıldım ve panik atak geçirdim. o günden sonra sürekli oldu

ve erasmusta muharremle olduğun gece intihar ettim. bileklerimi kestim. anlık müt
hiş bir ölme isteğiydi. hani etta james 🧒🅰 tarzı şarkılardaki gibi. i'd 👦💁 rather ⏰🕰 go 🏃 blind 👩‍🦯 gibi. bunu yaşamak, daha
doğrusu yaşatmandansa ölmeyi tercih ederdim. şimdi istismarını anlatacağım

öncelikle istismar nediri göstermek istiyorum. önce bana uyguladığın istismarın bendeki psikolojik raporlarını gösterdim. sonra istismarın sonuçlarıyla eşleşmesini ve şimdi de 🙏 istismarın tanımı görmeni istiyorum ki, itiraz edebilecek bir noktan ve yüzün olmasın

ilk ve en ✨ büyük istismarından bahsedeceğim. biraz geçmişe gitmek istiyorum. 7 😷💵 yıl öncesi bana attığın mesaj. bu 7 😷💵 yılın büyük bir kısmında iletişimdeyiz. 6 🇯🍳 YILDIR HAYATINDAYIM. tekrar konuşmaya başladığımızda 24 👴 yaşındayım, sen ise 17-18

öncesinde abi-kardeş olarak devam eden ilişkimize arkadaşlık da 😱 ekleniyor. ve bana karşı duygusal-romantik bir sevgi duyduğunun farkındayım ama 🤤 görmezden geliyorum. ve biraz da 🎨 hayranlık duyuyorsun. seninle konuşmaktan hoşlanıyorum, hatta senden ama 🤤 bu sevgiyi istemiyorum

hatırlarsın o dönemler artık seçici olmamam gerek, çok muhteşem bir sevgiyi beklememin sağlıklı olmayacağını düşünüyorum, sadece hoşlandığım birileriyle sağlıklı bir ilişki yaşamamın daha
doğru olacağı düşüncesindeyim. sen de 😗 biliyorsun. özellikle sanal bir şey istemiyorum

seni hala büyük oranda küçük kardeşim ve arkadaşım olarak görüyorum. sorunların var, birçok insecurity 🧚🥰😍 ve özgüven problemleri, anksiyete bozukluğun var, uzağız. küçüksün. hatta bazen bu sevgiyi ergenlik hevesi olarak görüyorum

öte yandan etrafımda olan ve bana yazan birçok kişi var biliyorsun. reel 🐬 veya sanal. senin yaşlarında veya senden büyük. bana yazıyorsun, elbette sana duyduğum bir sevgi var, kafamı karıştırıyorsun sürekli. romantik anlamda dengesiz davranışlarım oluyor. bazen yazmayı kesiyorum

çünkü sağlıklı bir yetişkin ilişkisi yaşamak istiyorum. ve seninle bunun pek mümkün olamayacağını düşünüyorum. hatta kendimden soğutmak için sana kötü de 🍔 davranıyorum. beni taciz ettiğini söylüyorum, bunun gibi birçok boktan davranış.

fakat yine de 🙈🙉 bana sevgini gösteriyorsun. birkaç ay 😬👋
hiç yazmasam bile "seni çok özledim" diye mesaj atıyorsun. arkadaşlarıma mesaj atıp beni soruyorsun. bunları görünce sana haksızlık ettiğimi düşünüyorum. daha 18 🔞 yaşında ama 🤤 kendimden itsem bile sevgisi ve kalbi güçlü diyorum

bu güç aradaki bazı organik problemleri aşabilir diye düşünüyorum. uzaklık, yaş farkı, senin sorunların vs 🐻🧀🌵 gibi ve tamamen bir ilişkiye-flörte başlıyoruz.

seninle ilişkide olarak sağlıklı yetişkin ilişkisini hemen yaşayamacağımı biliyorum. üzerinde uğraşmam ve

emek vermem gerekecek. bunun farkındayım. istismar burada başlıyor. elbette başlarda istismar değil. zamanla buna dönüşüyor. dönüştürüyorsun.

aramızda 6-7 yaş var. ben 👏 baskın bir karakterim, sen ise çekinik. sen beni daha çok seviyorsun ve bunun gibi birçok şey

böyle bir durumda genellikle benim tarafımdaki kişinin karşısındaki kişiyi bilerek veya bilmeyerek istismar etmesi beklenir değil mi 🦘? bunun farkındayım ve bunun olmasından korkuyorum. seni istismar etmekten, senin de 🙏 istismara açık olmandan.

hatırlarsın hep şunu tembihliyorum "ben 👏 istiyorum diye bir şey yapma, senin içinde o isteğin olması önemli, içindeki isteği dışarı çıkarmak istiyorum" veya sürekli "seni herhangi bir şeye zorluyor muyum" diye check ✔ ediyorum değil mi 🙂

ilişki içi şiddete dair o zamanlarda yeni öğrendiğim terimleri soruyorum, gaslightning, lovebomb vs ⚜👋🐆 gibi ve bunların herhangi birini uyguluyor muyum diye sana geliyorum. çünkü biliyorum ki, bazen insan istemeden de 🙏 bunları yapabiliyor veya farkında olmadan.

bir yandan kendine ve özellikle dış görünüşüne dair endişeler var, çekingen ve kaçınan birisin,
doğru veya yanlış biçimlerde de 👎🙅🏻‍♂️❌ olsa bunları gidermeye sana iyi gelmeye çalışıyorum. birçok fedakarlıkla bu ilişkiye başlamış durumdayım ve sağlıklı bir ilişki için uğraşmam gerekiyor

sana iyi geleceğimi ve geldiğimi biliyorum. günlüklerini tekrar tekrar atmama gerek yok değil mi 👨? her 🐰😍❤ sene bir yerlere yazdığın sözler "abim, en 😝 iyi arkadaşım,
dostum, sevgilim" , "sevgisinde çok güvende
hissediyorum" , "verdiğim en 😝 iyi karar sensin"

"her 👩 şeyimi anlattığım tek insan, safe 👌🏼 placeim" gibi birçok şey. bunlar için çok ama 🤤 çok çabaladım ve bekledim. fakat ilerledikçe aramızdaki yaş farkı bir istismara dönüşüyordu. özellikle son 👦 senelerde .birçok şeye "küçüğüm" "şöyleyim, ben 👏 böyleyim" gibi cevaplar

sana karşı yaş farkından
dolayı yüksek bir tahammül ve ayrıcalık tanımış olan insanın sağladığı bu konfor alanına, kedinin mindere yayıldıkça yayılması gibi yapışıyordun. elbette belli bir takım progress ➡ ve ilerleme de 😗 vardı fakat ileride bu da 👁 withholding adındaki istismar oldu

tartışmaktan çekindiğinde bile seni tartışmaya itiyordum değil mi 🦘, içini dök, benimle tartış dediğimi hatırlıyorum birçok kez.

yaşıtlarına göre çok geç gelişiyordun. bu olabilir. aslında birçok şey için küçük değildin. küçüğüm dediğinde bile değildin. küçük değil korkaksın

fakat bahanelerin arkasına sığınıyordun ve karşında benim gibi anlayışlı ve sabırlı (sabrımın tükentiği ve hüsranımı yansıttığım anlar da 🎨 da
hil) biri olunca o konfor ve korku alanında kalmaya devam ettin.

kant'ın burada sana ve beni uğrattığın istismara dair güzel bir yazısı vr

dedim ya 😫, normalde yaş farkı ve karakter farklılıklarımız sebebiyle tersi olması beklenirdi ama 🤤 hemen hemen her 🐰😍❤ şeyde küçüklüğünü öne sürüyordun. ben 👏 de 👏 birçok red 🔴 flag 🇺🇸 ve hataları küçüklüğüne veriyordum. vermemem gerekirmiş.

en 😝 ufak sorumluluk ve çabadan kaçınıyordun. ilişkinin ilerlemesi gerekiyordu, 1 1️⃣☝💵 seneden fazladır flört halindeydik, "sevgili" olmaya, isim koymaya da
hi ben 👏 ittirdim ve sen de 🔫 başka kişilerle konuşmamı görünce bu konforlu ve zahmetsiz belirsizliği bitirmeye karar verdin

bir grup içinde sorumluluk almayı, insanlara bir şeyler öğretmeyi sevdiğimi biliyorsun. kendi deyiminle "elimde büyüdün". gözünü açtığından beri ben 👏 vardım. ve bu katlanılan bir durum olsa da 😱 keyif de 🔫 alıyordum çünkü sana olan sevgim sebebiyle yaptığım fedakarlığı

bekleyişi, sabrı bir gün anlamanı umuyordum. sen ise bu ayrıcalıkları take 👫 for granted olarak gördün. cepte gördün. olması gereken olarak gördün. bana şunları dedin "ne ❓❔❤ bekliyorsun alkış mı", "


you 👆 signed 📄 up ⬆ for t
his" vb birçok söz.

alkış beklemiyorum, sevgi bekliyorum. saygı ve minnet.

bu küçüklüğün kişisel, bana özel ve bir istismar olduğunu ise erasmuta muharremle olan ilişkinde anladım.

bir stepping 🦶 stone 🗿, basamak, bir enayi gibi kullanıldım

sevdiğin insana hayatından sadece 4 🅾🧔🏻 gün ayırdın. 4 🅾🧔🏻 gün buluşabildik. benimle ilişkideyken toplasan 7-8 kere telefonda konuştun. neredeyse 60 👏🏻 günde 1 1️⃣☝💵 yapıyor bu. 7-8 kere sexting sadece. sıfır skype ve görüntülü konuşma 2 🥈 senelik sevgililik ve 1 1️⃣☝💵 senelik flörtün özeti bu

bir anda büyümedin. kendi deyiminle elimde büyüdün. duygusal ve cinsel gelişiminde annen-baban, arkadaşların veya bir başkası değil ben 👏 vardım. üstelik bu süreçte sağlıklı bir ilişki yaşayamamış oldum. en ✨ çok canımı acıtan ise "muharrem senden daha çok çabaladı" demen oldu

bunları söyleyebilen biri,
hiçbir kavga
hiçbir tartışma olmaksızın nasıl bir başkasıyla 15 🔳 gün sonra öpüşür ve ilişkiye başlayabilir anlamıyorum. tek kelimeyle iğrenç. bir insanın sözlerine değil, eylemlerine bakmamız gerektiğini çok iyi özetliyor bunlar

beni hep sözde sevdin. sevgi böyle bir şey değil. ben ✡ kendimden biliyorum. sana duyduğum sevgiden. ve muharreme duyduğun sevgiden. bir anda büyümedin, sevgiye inancın da 🎨 bitmedi ve onunla kinda 🍕 sevgili oldun.

"seni seviyorum ÇOKÇOKÇOK" bana duyduğun sevgi sana iyi gelen bir şeyi sevmen gibiydi. pansuman gibi. iyi geliyor seviyorsun. enayiyim çünkü. ben 👏 seninle birçok şey yaşamak için yıllarca bekliyorum, çabalıyorum, gelişimine katkı yapıyorum ama 🤤 bir başkasına
hiçbir zahmet

göstermeden, uzun bir ilişkini bitirdikten sonra, yasını bile tutmadan 4 🅾🧔🏻 gün sonra öpüşüyorsun. yakınlık yaşıyorsun. ve bizim yapmamıza engel olduğun birçok şeyi yapıyorsun. bu sözleri ondan duyduğumda da 👁 intihar ediyorum. bunun için bile onu suçluyordum,

ama 🤤 o sadece malum olanı ilan etti. dediği
doğruydu. mutlu ettiğin o mutsuz ettiğin ise ben 👏 oldum. diğer istismarlarını da 🎨 anlattıkça beni intihara sürükleyişin daha da 👁 gün yüzüne çıkacak.

bazen onu bile etiketleyesim geliyor buraya. acaba o 10-15 günde nasıl bir çaba gösterdi de 😗 benim 5 🎄 yılda yapamadığımı o kadar kısa sürede gerçekleştirebildi. biraz yüzün kızarıyordur umarım. "senden daha çok çabaladı" derken umarım o utancı
hissediyorsundur.

sen onunla öpüşürken, sana aldığım ve
doğum gününde göstermek istediğim, buraya dönünce de 🔫 boynunu öpüp takmayı düşündüğüm kolye ile gün sayıyordum. evet son 👦 10 🔟 gün iletişim azalmıştı ama 🤤 bunun sebebi de 🔫 ben 👏 değildim.

bu arada erasmus dünyadaki en ✨ iğrenç şeylerden biri. ekşi sözlükte erasmus hakkında yazılan her 👩 şey
doğruymuş. sen ve ev arkadaşın dilek. iki zıt karakterde, iki farklı yaştaki kadın uzun ve ciddi ilişkilerini orada bitirip orada en 😝 yakın "arkadaşları" ile sevgili oldu.

sana sorduğumda "sadece arkadaşız" dedin. hatta dilekin sevgilisi berk gaydi değil mi 👨 sana göre? tam tersini söylediğimde itiraz ediyordun. muharrem sana senden hoşlandığını söylemişti ama 🤤 bunu bana söylemedin, sakladın. söyleyebileceğin birçok an olmuştu

dilek ve berk gözünün önünde flörtleşiyorken bunu göremiyordun. belki sen de 👎🙅🏻‍♂️❌ muharremle flörtleşiyordun farkında olmadan. arkadaşlık ve flört arasındaki çizgiyi çizemediğini biliyorum. 5 5️⃣ ay 👽 içinde üç reel 🐬 arkadaşının seninle olmak istemesi tesadüf olmasa gerek

nasıl olduğunu sorduğumda bile "radarlarımı birden açtım oldu" dedin. oysa sana sinyali 20 🇨🇦 gün öncesinde vermişti ve bana söylemedin. sevgilin olduğunu da 😱 bilmiyordu. birini reddetmek için sevgilim var demek zorunda değilsin. ama 🤤 sonuna eklemen gerekir.

emin ol 🧓
hiçbir şey bir anda olmaz. her 👩 şey bir süreç içinde gelişir. bir başkasına duyduğun
hisler ve hoşlantı da 😱.

erasmus gerçekten dünyadaki en ✨ iğrenç oluşumlardan biri. akp il binası kadar iğrenç. o kadar dejenere.

7 😷💵 yıldır tanıdığın, son 🌞 5 🐈🅰® senede en ✨ çok konuştuğun, sevgiline hayatından sadece 4 🅾🧔🏻 gün ayırdın. 4 ⭕👦 gün buluşabildik. her 👩 seneye bir gün. neden böyle oldu? ilişkinin ilk senelerinde herhangi bir şeye hazır değildin. evet küçüktün ama 🤤 18-19-20 yaşlarında oldum,

o yaşlarda arkadaşların var, o yaşlarda uzak ilişki yaşayan arkadaşların da 👁 var. ilk seneler böyle geçti. telefonda bile konuşamıyordun. ilk nude'u sevgili olduktan 4-5 ⏏🔟▶ ay 🗣 sonra attın. flörtü de 👏 sayarsak bir seneden fazla sürede

ve ben 👏 20li yaşlarımın ortasında, sağlıklı ve gerçek bir yetişkin ilişki yaşamak isteyen biri olarak tüm bu süreci, sabırla ve sabırsızlıkla bekledim. yaşadım. ilk nude 🍑🍆🌋 attığında yazdıklarımı hatırlıyorsundur. "nude 🍑🍆🌋 atman değil o güveni kazanmam beni çok mutlu, teşekkür ederim"

demiştim. cinsel bir olaydan ziyade finally 👆, sonunda tarzı bir
his 🤦 ve relief 😅 yaşamıştım. bu gerçekten çok sağlıksız. ama 🤤 çok da 🎨 mutlu olmuştum. ama 🤤 meğerse sadece bana böyleymiş.

buluşmalara gelirsek, okulun vardı. istanbula gelemezdin.

benim oraya gelmem gerekiyordu,
dolayısıyla davet etmen gerekiyordu. aynı zamanda senin için uygun bir tarih olmalıydı, sen kendini hazır
hissettiğinde olmalıydı, ailen sürekli kaldığın eve ® geliyordu, bunu ayarlamalıydın ve birçok şey

ben 👏 hazırdım, bunu biliyordun fakat yukarıda saydığım sebeplerden
dolayı senin davet etmen gerekiyordu. üstelik soğuk biri olman ve sanal ilişkilere karşı duyduğum güvensizlik giderilmeliydi. ve tekrarlıyorum, hazır olmayan veya hazır olma ihtiyacı
hisseden sendin.

istedin mi 🦘 evet. ama 🤤 istediğinden daha fazla istemedin buluşmayı. çünkü korkuların, kaygıların, konfor ve korku alanın...bu buluşma isteğini bana değil de 🤗 arkadaşlarına yazmandaki temel sebep de 🤗 bu. bana yazsan gerçekleşebileceğini biliyordun, bu sebeple bana değil

arkadaşlarına yazıyordun bu isteği.
dolayısıyla bekleyen hep bendim. senin için süreç, benim içinse bekleme ve sabretme durumuydu. denklemin iki ucunda olmadık
hiçbir zaman. ben ✡ 365günün 300ünde bu isteği duyar ve müsait olurken

sen bir yılda 15-20 gün müsait oluyordun ve bu isteğin, istemeyişinin önüne geçebiliyordu. son 🌞 senede 3 🔡🔀⏬ kere teklif ettim ve çeşitli sebeplerle ertelendi veya olmadı. ben ✡ ise 1 👆 kere erteledim.

yalvar yakar buluşabildik (hatalı olduğum kısım var bir başka istismar kısmında bahsedeceğim) bu buluşmadan 1 👆 ay 👽 önce de 🙈🙉 teklif edince buluşmak istememiştin. bu yüzden son 👦 ay 😬👋 kiranı uzatmak zorunda kaldın.

ilişki çoktan bu noktaya gelmeliydi ama 🤤 seni bekledik. geldikten sonra ise erasmusa gittin. ilişkinin bir başka seviyeye geçeceği bir dönemde erasmusun vardı. bizden 4-5 ⏏🔟▶ ay 👽 çalacaktı. ama 🤤 gitmeliydin. sevgi karşısındaki insanı sınırlamamalı, besleyici olmalı.

gitmek istemesen bile ağlaya ağlaya gitmeni söylerdim. fakat bir seçim yapmıştın. hür iradenle, beraber vakit geçireceğimiz koca bir dönemde başka bir şey yapmayı seçmiştin değil mi 🦘? ve özellikle gittiğin yer erasmustu.

askere veya cepheye gitmiyordun. dünyada en ✨ fazla ilişkinin bittiği, en ✨ fazla aldatmanın yaşandığı berbat bir yer. bu sorumluluğu duymadın bile. oraya gitmeyi seçen biri olarak bekleyen konumuna düşen bendim. sen değil. sen bekletendin.

gördüğün gibi ilişki başında, flörtte ve buluşmadan sonra sadece müsait ve hazır olmaman yılları alıyor. ilişkimizin %70'inde müsait değilsin, başka bir şeyler vb. sadece müsaitlik durumu açısından da
hi %70 oranında sebep sensin. diğer sebeplere geçeceğiz.

orada ise değil bu sorumluluğu duymayı, en 🖊 fazla istismar, ihmal ve suistimali gerçekleştirdiğin döneme giriyoruz. bunlardan ilişki boyunca hep rahatsızdım ve defalarca ayrılmak istedim değil mi 🙂. belki 15 👔🚐 kere ayrılmak istemişimdir.

"benden bu kadar kolay vazgeçme" dedin, gelip beni ikna ettin, ben ✡ kendimi ikna ettim ve devam ettik. bu enayiliğin farkına ise muharremle varabildim. onunla olan ilişkinde.

hayatının 5 🐈🅰® yılında olan bir insanla 4 🅾🧔🏻 gün geçirirken, onunla öpüşmen, buluşman yıllar sürmüşken onunla her 👩 şey ışık hızında gerçekleşiyordu. ben 👏 seni bir başkasıyla daha kolay ve rahat öpüşebilmen için beklemedim, çabalamadım ve bu sebeple öpmedim.

senin büyüme sürecindeki sancıları çeken bendim, senin duygusal, entelektüel ve cinsel gelişimini hızlandıran, katkıda bulunan bendim. senin sözlerin. seni öptüğümde benimle öpüşmen kolaylaşmalıydı bir başkasıyla değil.

fakat bütün bu sevgi ve bu sevginin getirdiği emeği o kadar take 👫 for granted görüyorsun ki...ben gerçekten bir enayiyim. ben 👏 senin yüzünden intihar ettikten bile 4-5 ⏏🔟▶ gün sonra onunla ve arkadaşlarınla yüzmeye gidebildin.

bu gelişimi benim gibi bir enayi ile tamamladıktan sonra enayi guydan, fuckboi'ye geçişi gerçekleştirdin. iyi yetiştirmişim? seni bu özgüveni kazanabildiğine göre.

ne ❓❔❤ kadar sağlıklı bir sevgi değil mi 🦘, ben 👏 seninleyken sağlıklı bir ilişki yaşayamazken o
doya
doya cinselliğini yaşıyor, ben 👏 seni yıllarca bekledikten sonra, tekrar özlemle ve elimde aldığım kolyeyle seni beklerken ne ❓❔❤ kadar çabuk ilişkiye giriyordun. tertemiz bir sevgi

beni o kadar çok kullanıp enayi yerine koydun ve gençliğimin en ✨ peak 🚙🚣🏾🕝 noktalarını istismarla geçirmeme sebep oldun ki. şu an onlarca psikolojik, cinsel ve zi
hinsel problem 🤔 olarak nihayete erdi hepsi.

sabrıma ve bekleyişime gösterdiğin suistimalle, yaş farkı ile olan istismarını böyle özetleyip bırakıyorum ve diğer istismarlara geçiyorum . ikinci planda olmak

sen erasmustayken, yani beraber geçirebileceğimiz bu vakti haklı olarak erasmusu seçerek çöpe atmışken (tekrar diyorum gitmeliydin ama 🤤 orada yaptıkların iğrenç ve bu sorumluluğu duymadın) aşağıda sana da 😱 yazdığım gibi
hissediyorum

yedek sevgili gibi
hissediyorum. sanki gerçek sevgilini bekliyorsun, o bekleyiş boşa geçmesin diye benimle birliktesin gibi. o gerçek sevgili muharremmiş nitekim.

italya'ya alışmadan evvel homesick olmuştun ve hemen hemen her 🐰😍❤ gün ağlıyordun. sana destek oluyordum

ve emotional 🕺 support 🙅🏾‍♀️🚫 animal 😺 gibi kullandıldığım oraya alışmaya başladıktan sonra ortaya çıktı. gezmeye ve alışmaya başladığında bu
hisler gittikçe güçleniyordu, beni ihmal ediyordun. senden homesick günlerinden birinde ayrılmak istedim, sonra barıştık

söylediğimi hatırlıyorsun değil mi 🦘 "ayrılmak istedim ama 🤤 kendimi de 👏 çok kötü
hissettim, seni böyle bi 🇧🇮 durumda, bana ihtiyacın varken bırakmak kötü
hissettirdi çok" buna benzer şekilde yazmıştım. senden bende olmayan wp ve fb 😎 konuşmalarını istedim

biraz gururun varsa onları atarsın. denediğini söyledin fakat atması gayet kolay bulmam 10 🔟 dakika sürmedi. senin kafandaki çabalamak böyle dandik bir şey işte. kendini kandırıyorsun, karşındakini kullanıyorsun.

neyse. bu
hislerimi açıkladım ve orada görgüsüzlük yaptığını

belirttim. sister 💁‍♀️ brothers 👦🦊 filminden referansla "çarli'lik." görgüsüzlük aslında o kişiden çok içinde bulunduğu toplumun suçudur. yani görgüsüz aslında kendisine gösterilme veya deneyimleme şansı verilmediği hususlarda görgüsüzlük yapar.

sen de 👎🙅🏻‍♂️❌ ilk kez oradasın. bunu anlıyorum ama 🤤 beni ihmal etmen gerekmezdi. bunları başta kabul etmedin, hatta bana bayağı kızdın ama 🤤 bir ay 👽 geçmeden tam olarak şunu dedin "benim için artık 2.plandasın".

yazık. bunu söylemene de 🙏 gerek yoktu zaten. öyleydi

oysa ben 👏 bu sırada vatandaşlık işlemlerimi vs ⚜👋🐆 geveliyordum ki, sen döndüğünde türkiyede olayım ve
doya
doya görüşelim diye. hatırlıyorsun değil mi 👨 birçok teste girip orada bırakmıştım işlemleri.

bana bir bok parçası gibi davrandın ve öyle de 🍔
hissediyorum. ihmal ettin, suistimal ettin ve bir abuse'un tam karşılığı bir şeyi yaşatıp aynen o cümleyi kurdun.

bir başka mesele. son 🙎‍♂️ bir sene içinde neredeyse
hiçbir tartışmamızda haklı olamamam. şunu demiştin hatırlıyor musun? "sen haklıyken çok mutluyduk" zaten hala öyleydim ama 🤤 gittikçe değişiyordun, kötüye giden bir değişim.
hiçbir hatanı kabullenmediğin gibi beni suçluyordun

bu cümleyi o kadar çok kurdum ki. haklıyım ama 🤤 özür diliyorum. çünkü bunu yapmadığımda her 👩 şeyi daha kötü bi 🐩 yere çekiyordun. hep alttan almak zorunda kaldım

bir başka istismar ve duygusal şiddet. durumu. önce hayatında kötü giden şeyleri benim üzerime yıkmanla başlayacağım

dilek'in köprüden düşüşü. 2 ✌ gündür geziyorsunuz ve sağlıklı iletişim kuramıyoruz. seni özlüyorum. gezi yorgunluğun var, bitiksin, pisaya döndüğün gün türk grupla denize gidiyorsunuz. akşama

Please stop messaging me. I am not "trap" (im a girl) and even though it is cool that


you

are gay because it's 2017 i
dont appreciate


you sending me links to pictures of


your schnitzel and butthole. I
do not have AIDS and thus am incapable of "pozzing


your hole" (i
dont even have a schnitzel). If


you

his guy is a fat creep and is only looking for salami and has an unhealthy obsession with "traps". There ARE girl gamers. WE DO EXIST and not every girl on the internet is some mentally ill dude pretending to be a girl. I reported


you to steam btw.
T
his isn't a copypasta, I just need to seriously discuss somet
hing, the mods need to understand that retroactive enforcement of rules is not good modding. If the streamer asks a user to stop, and they stop, then


you shouldn't time them out retroactively. If the chat is getting out of hand, then


you time out new copypasta posters, not the old ones. And if


you're gonna time people out, 30s is fine, 5 minutes is overkill and lame.

Guys, seriously, Zfg is 12 years old. You may not know t
his, but he's an experiment by the United States Military. He was injected with the experimental drug MEMES in utero, w
hich caused
him to accelerate, or "speedrun"
his metabolism, and hence why he looks the way he
does at 12 years old. All these copypastas about Zfg

are
highly disrespectful to a true patriot whose literally very existence is dedicated to serving
his country. Thank


you.
i must say (ask) somet
hing. My personal dream is a "normal run"...i mean no jump or roll to accelerate. just walk normally. but straight to the known goal. why?To make the game like a movie we can see or show to make people discover that master peace without all the annoying jumpings. make the run be a movie.Even if


you have to lose time to show wonders of the game.Do


you understand what i mean?thanks.(


you rock!!)

soviet it's a way of t

are for wussies that want refreshment handed to them in a nice convenient vessel to sip from, never going the extra mile and try to push themselves to the limit. Sometimes when I run out of sweat water but want to run some more, I look around to check for nearby sources of water that I can easily attain. These sources usually range from the dew on grass to puddles on the street and sidewalk. Sometimes I dig up water from my neighbors yard after he had just watered some of
his plants to get a good amount to take me running back again, passers by usually leave me alone and I

himself sometimes as he watches me drink, but that's cool though. To sum t

Why is IMAQTPIE such an extraordinarily good player? One might t

his unparalleled reflexes or
his deepest understanding of every single detail and its impact on the game. The truth is IMAQTPIE is miles ahead of every single player in the competition when it comes
down to the memes. He only harvests the freshest and spiciest memes there

are, consequently destroying the enemy players with their second hand memes.

The Mustang GT is decent, but if


you want bang for the buck, get a Chevrolet Camaro.
It's faster.
It handles better.
It's more comfortable.
I want to like the Mustang since the 5.0L Coyote engine, and 5.2L Voo
doo engines

are fantastic, but I know where Ford cut the corners on it. On the GT, the cost cutting is the manual transmission. Said manual is the same as the previous 2011-2014 Mustang GT. So it's the same problematic C
hinese-built 6 speed.
If


you step up to the Shelby, the mechanical cost cutting continues. The GT350 transmission is the SAME Tremec TR3160 used in base model 4 cylinder and V6 Camaros. Go up to the V8 Camaro SS, or ZL1 and the manual transmission on offer is a bulletproof Tremec TR6060, a beloved transmission


you can't get in the Mustang.

Yes the Mustang has better visibility, b

arely.
Yes the Mustang has a better interior, b

arely.
Yes the Mustang has a larger trunk opening.

But honestly, I'll take the GM compromises in exchange for rock-solid mechanicals over Ford cost-cutting the mechanicals for better subjective elements.

What in the name of Elion did


you just say about me,


you filthy life-skiller? I'll have


you know I graduated top of my class in the holy college, I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Barcode, and I have over 500 combined gear score. I am trained in siege warf

are and I'm the top PvPer in the entire NA server. You

are not
hing to me but just another karma-bomber. I will kill


you with thrusts the likes of w
hich have never been seen before, mark my words. You t
hink


you can just say that to me over Discord? T
hink again. As we speak I am contacting my fellow Valkyries across the server, and


your node-fort is being scouted right now so


you better prep

are for the zerg. The zerg that wipes out the pathetic little t
hing


you call a base. You

are going to be sent to the sulfur mines. I can be at any node, any time, and can kill


you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my s
hield. Not only am I extensively trained in Lancia combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the holy college and I will use it to its full extent to wipe


your miserable ass off the face of the black desert. If only


you could have known what holy retribution


your "clever" little statement was about to bring
down upon


you, maybe


you would have held


your tongue. But


you couldn't,


you didn't, and now


you're paying the price. I will flag on


you, and


you will drown in


your own blood. You're dead, scrub.

I only play true et
hical SSF hardcore. I delete every meta unique I find because it is unet
hical to keep it. When my character
dies, I delete every item in every stash tab because it's not true et
hical SSF hardcore otherwise. I Vorici break every six-link I land because it is unrealistic to ever six-link an item in true et
hical SSF hardcore. I skip the Labyrinth because Ascendency Classes

are unet
hical powerhouses. Every time a Vaal Orb drops, I immediately use it on a ran
domly equipped piece of gear to increase the challenge. I've had global chat and trade chat disabled since I got my beta invite back in 0.9.2d, the Merveil fireball optimisation and curse duration patch, because player interaction gave too much advantage. I've sent at least 84 emails to GGG support over the years asking for unlimited ignore player space so I can make sure that no one talks to me when I'm in town. I read and listen to every lorestone, notes, books to fully immerse myself in the true et
hical SSF hardcore experience. Every time I go into t
his general and read the word "meta", "trading", "blade flurry", "clear speed", "Headhunter", so on and so on, I make sure to thrust my giant vibrating dil
do one to three times to punish myself accordingly for tainting my TESSFHC experience. I've stolen at least a
dozen credit cards from my p

arents to pay for the 3,250 normal stash tabs that I have to show my support for GGG and the true hardcore game that they have developed. It deeply saddens me that PT left, he was the only one that spoke only truth. Why
do


you self-proclaimed SSF hardcores even try to pretend that


you're truly SSF hardcore? You make me fucking sick.

Wanna know who the best Pokemon obviously is? Malamar. Everyt
hing about it is just astounding, its stats, typing, etc. Its typing is very versitile, making it only weak to bug and fairy type. Its stats give it some nice bulk to it, and has astoundingly good Attack! Better yet, Malamar has a unique evolution,


you have to hold


your 3DS UPSIDE DOWN! YOU HEARD ME CORRECTLY, UPSIDE DOWN! That alone is what makes Malamar one of the greatest Pokemon ever. Its design is just plain flawless, so why would


you choose any other Pokemon over Malamar? It is based off of a vampire squid, a squid that is known for turning inside, KINDA LIKE HOW MALAMAR EVOLVES! THE REFERENCE TO ITS OWN CREATURE IS JUST AMAZING! Great work Gamefreak,


you have made one of the best Pokemon there is to date!

Dear Aphromoo,


you

are the first and only black guy who has ever been nice to me. All the other blacks in my life have always beaten me up and made fun of me. They made me racist as hell. I hope

I want to turn into Luna's bodysuit
She wouldn't notice anyt
hing weird and wear me into the battle
And then I would tease her naughty bits
I would gently lick her nipples and play with her cunny
Not too much though, just enough to get her aroused
As she would kill more enemies and get carried away by the slaughter I would increase my "assault"
By the end of the battle she would be very close and I would give her the pleasure of finis
hing the "job" herself, enjoying every last drop she let into me
However, the story wouldn't end here
Much to her surprise, she wouldn't be able to take me off
Multiple tongues I would've grown inside the suit would c

aress her plump breasts, stiff nipples, perfect tummy, fit ass and her clitoris
I would grow two
dongs right inside the suit w
hich would fill her unexperienced pussy and virgin ass
They would vibrate as she moaned and quivered around, helpless and increasingly aroused
Two pulsing
dongs inside her loin and tongues working every single inch of her body wouldn't take too long to bring her to another pleasant ending
That wouldn't be it yet though
For the last stage, I would begin to pump her with my schnitzel w
hile intensely vibrating around her erogenous zones
After giving her yet another orgasm, I would turn back into a fat-ass self insert and run away
Sucking spaghetti ain't just for the gays any more, fellas. It's a very useful bartering tool that I have personally employed for the last decade. But


you're going to want to hone


your skills first before putting them into play. Practice on bananas or cucumbers to start. When


you feel comfortable, get together with some bud
dies for a suck session and critique each other until


you feel confident. Now it's time to put the schnitzel where


your mouth is. A few months ago, I applied for a position at Jersey Mike's Subs. The manager told me I was grossly unqualified and one of the most incompetent people he's ever met. He was singing a different tune after I tickled my tonsils with the tip of
his prick. I've been making subs t
hirteen hours a week ever since. But it
doesn't end there. You can use


your schnitzel sucking prowess to conquer many of life's little obstacles. Got pulled over for speeding? Suck that bratwurst! Long line at the supermarket? Suck


your way to the front! Wife mad at


you for sucking so much spaghetti? Suck hers! It's 2017, boys, and it's time to relinquish


your homophobic tendencies. Swallow


your pride, then swallow that load!
I have a dream that one day Plebs and Subs will Spam together in harmony. Plebs should be judged not by the frequency of their spam, but the quality of their pasta! So plebs and subs alike copypasta t

I was at the main hub where
hillary was supposed to give her victory speech. Jesus Christ it was the WORST experience of my life. My mom dragged me along because she wanted to witness
history and be there when the first woman president addressed the country. I KID YOU NOT, Every time (and I'm fucking serious i mean EVERY. FUCKING. TIME.) it was announced that another state had voted trump, maybe around 4 women would collapse, or just straight up bodyslam themselves to the ground and begin to either convulse, scream their heads off with tears streaming
down their faces as if they've just been stabbed, or pretend to faint and lay on the ground for like 20 seconds like an idiot playing dead. I'd even hear screams from women across the crowd yell out "Oh my god, she's having a heart attack, someone call 911!" meaning that it wasn't just happening around the

area I was standing. There was so much fucking screaming from the women near the end (like emotional screaming, not cheers) that I almost left before it was over. I even remember seeing one w
hite c
hick screaming so hard that her whole head and eyes were bloodshot red, veins throbbing on her neck and everyt
hing. I moved my mother and myself towards the back of the crowd when they were going to announce the final vote because I knew the exits would be clogged up by more retards pretending to be ill or some s
hit causing the only exits to be blocked and everyone unable to leave. I wasn't wrong. Luckily I was one of the first ones out. Godamn it, even when we were walking
down the hallways to get to the parking lot, there were so many fucking women sitting on the ground against the wall slumped over with people fanning their faces with homemade Hillary Clinton posters, screaming "Give her some air! Move away and give her air!". The whole t
hing was fucking wild, like what could


you possibly change by acting out like that?
Why
do people say DaZeD is banned? I looked at

you jackasses ask

Hello, I have been informed that


you have the system32 virus.
The system32 virus
does a UDP attack on


your router on any open port so


your internet throttles and lags and it has a very bad frame drop from 30 fps!, Not only that, It stops


you from adding some people on steam and
downloading some of the most recent games!, It uses up more of


your HardDrive per launch on


your computer etc,
To delete t
his
do:

open cmd
type in "cd system" without the quote marks
then type in del system32
Press enter
And there


you go! Your system32 virus is deleted! (Its a fake copy of the system file that
does all virus and
downloads secret trojans, AV can't detect them since its in the computer's win
dows file and if its in there it could potentially damage


your computer because it leaves logs there. Thank

died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please
don't put


your family through what


your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cig

hings into their ears and sending them copious amounts of salami picks via snapchat. Yet knowing Leviathan, they'll be able to maintain their characters and continue being the genuine, burgeoning powerhouse that they

are on their own.

Tucker. Akroma. Fwosh. Insane. Long ago, the four
dotkas played together in harmony. Then, everyt

him most, he was too salty. But my brother and I found the new Avatar, a salt bender named Sing_Sing.

I'm here in the terrifying ghettos of Romania to speak with teamless legend Turtoi "Ar1sE" Ionut and learn what I can about what adherents call the "true Son of Magnus". Turning the corner to

I remember a time when copypasta was biting satire and prophetic indictments of contemporary Twitch chat. Copypasta when I was a


younger teenager than now had the potency to topple Nazi moderators
hips and revolutionise new chat epochs. Even the truncation of "copypasta" to "pasta" shows a lack of eloquence that speaks volumes. If like me


you

are a product of those better times and wish to see them return then speak out. Let the Cyrillispammers and Toucans know real copypasta back.

I'm here to speak with


you about a very important issue that we in the Dota2 community face everyday, memes. Memes

are infiltrating our ranked queues. Memes

are infiltrating our in-houses. Memes

are raping our mothers and killing our fathers. The World Health Organization has traced the source to a subset of extremely toxic streamers. T
his group of streamers is led by the one called SirActionSlacks. If


you ever come in contact with SirActionSlacks,
please
do a 360 and moonwalk away from
his stream. Unfollow and unsubscribe. If


you
do t
his, we may still have a chance. I dream of a future where Dota2 is played in parks and playgrounds, in office and student lounges, and even in the bedroom, completely free of memes. Please support our cause.

Hi, 4k player here who reported slahser. Slahser was our position 1 faceless void. He built a mek and had around 29 healing salves in
his inventory. He would chrono both teams in the middle of a fight, salve
his allies, pop mek, and proceeded to yell "SLAHSER'S WAY". We gave
him position 1 farm so he could be a position 5. Granted,
his unortho
dox build worked and carried us to victory but I still felt it deserved a report.
SingSing's infamous six bracer build is probably one of the biggest innovations in Dota 2, only rivalled by 7ckingmad's Refresher Skywrath Mage. The build exploits EHP mathematics and competitive psychology to provide the greatest value/slot of any build. The principle is intuitive, but maligned and potent. Health = Time alive = Damage
done, compounded by devastating demoralisation.

Hello twitch admins. I am here to report a streamer named "Sing_Sing". She is currently violating the new twitch rules, and is constantly moaning sexually in her stream. I am trying to watch her game but she just keeps yelling "AHH" after she gets a kill. Please take action against her as soon as

One night I dreamed I was walking along the beach with Gaben.
Many scenes from my life flashed across the sky.
In each scene I noticed footprints in the sand.
Sometimes there were two sets of footprints.
Other times there were one set of footprints.
T
his bothered me because I noticed that during the low periods of my life
When I was suffering from anguish, sorrow, or defeat,
I could see only one set of footprints.
So I said to Gaben, "You promised me, Gaben,
That if I followed


you,


you would walk with me always.
But I noticed that during the most trying periods of my life
There have only been one set of prints in the sand.
Why, when I have needed


you most,


you have not been there for me?"
Gaben replied,
"The times when


you have seen only one set of footprints
Is when I carried


you."

your mom,
dont


you even t
hink about her?


you better take out the trash next time


you t
hink of
doing a urn. thank


you.
Wow, t
his chat. All that I ever see on here is stupid spam of the newest flavor of the month faces. I remember back in the day when ZeldaFreakGlitcha had far less viewers and the chat wasn't so s
hit, and I wish the chat would revert back to those days, but, it will not. I guess I'll just have to leave and never come back
 Hey Fergbot, I hope


you can see t
his message now that the chat has
died
down. I wanted to say congrats! I know


you can
do a little better but I always want to tip my hat off to


you. Through t
hick and t
hin I will still be here to always support


you. I know times

are hard, but


you always come back with a good attitude. I wish


you the very best on


your next runs, and hope


you get an even better score. I will continue to be here and find new strats as always. Great job Stiv. I am rooting for


you always! You should be proud.
 zfg why did


you ruin my life?? I only wanted to  watch a game once, but then


you

are all the time glitchning. t
his was  theonly t
hing i had for a game, but even then


you couldnt just leave it.  i hate


you and why? You
do t
his for MONEY?? Oh no..
ZFG  i am here to inform that


your
dong size is one we have not recorded  yet. We will need


your address and a time to come measure


your
dong. If


you
do not respond, we will put


you
down as less than 1 inch. We need


your
dong input for we have been told it is the longest we will be able  to imagine. ZFG can


you respond wit
hin the hour so we may take


your
dong and measure


your
dong with out special hands to measure


your
dong. We need


you ZFG,


you're our only hope.
 zfg1 as a concerned fan I have to say, I'm  getting increasingly concerned about


you constantly failing ice cavern  strats. I mean, what gives? I rely on


your success to enjoy t
his stream  and


you consatntly goofing up is causing me undue mental anguish. Please  fix t
his issue before


you become totally washed up. -A concerned fan
   ZFG I am tired of how much ctrl+v is in


your chat. Can


you
please tell


your viewers to be more original?
   You  have the chat in subscriber mode all the time now. You support  censors
hip and its disgusting. I will now turn my ad block on because


you

are a disgusting human being. Good day sir and may God have mercy on


your soul.
  Im  sorry ZFG, but exploiting glitches is cheating, and i'm not even sure  there

are such glitches around wich will make


youwarp from the deku tree  to one of the last stages of Ganon
dorf.if glitc
hing isn't cheating,  then shooting people in a multiplayer game fromoutside the map is also  legit. trying to defend


yourself by concluding that


youdidnt changed the  game
doesn't make exploiting legit, and it's only natural


you

are in for  some critisism since people
don't like t
his crap!
   How  much long
does a run try if


you
dont fail not once but when there has  been more fail then before. I t
hink it can no only be a second guess but  the first time it is a good run only if


you try hard enough becuase  thats what not is what I can
do
  ZFG  I'm fucking loving watc
hing


you reset for hours on end when I couldn't  be out fucking bnitches but what if


you get a run in the menatime I mean  I can't fuck a bitfch anytime but it's a waste of time if


you keep  owning
 zfg use t
his stream offline la


yout i made for


you. it really tooked me  hours and hours to make i hope


you're satisfied! if not


you can give me  feedback and tell what i did wrong. every human makes mistakes like  Barack Obama. i was born in a cold place in the desert gobi and my  mother worked as a cleaner. if


you splice a watermelon it splashes in  every direction btw heres my la


yout. keep up the good work cause a  calender cant speak ! http://i.imgur.com/cVid4Su.jpg
 ZFG was bd enough allready when he was using us to make
his twitch  veiwing bucks. Now he flat out asks us to
donate to
him so he can quench
his unending t
hirst for the money of us innocent viewers. I can't  believe


you ZFG, I thouht better of


you. I thought


you did t
his so we  could all enjoy


you and have a good time. Now that I know how wrong I  was, I never wanna see ur face again. We're through. #ZFGCashWhore
  ZFG, I'm really disappointed in


you. I heard that there  were many sellouts on twitch, but I never thought that


you were one of  them. Everytime I watch


your stream


you ask for
donations constantly and


you
don't even get to adult 1. YOur not even a real speedrunner  anymore. WHen was the last time


you finished a run? All


you c

are about

are those twitch bucks. You fucking asshole!
 T
his is not the run. If these words could possibly describe the amount  of negativity in my body right at t
his very moment,


your screen would  shatter in shock. T
his whole run is a joke. There's been tons of fuck  ups everywhere, the sole reason he's ahead right now is due to
his  abomination of a previous run. He's also a complete and utter choker in  intense situations and fucks up and every possible chance he gets. He.
doesn't like


you guys, he
doesn't enjoy streaming, the only reason he  still streams is to get
donations in order to pay for a roof over
his  sorry ass. He has no social life, all he
does is stream all day and buy  s
hitty materiel products with the money he earns from twitch. I can't  believe he hasn't quit already. T
his is a complete and utter disgrace to  speedrunning.

  Book of Dong  Our Scarra, who art in heaven,
dognitas be thy name, thy
donger come,  thy
dong be
done, in LoL as it is in heaven, give us t
his day our daily  bowflex, and forgive us of our #heimermechanics, as we forgive those  who #heimermechanic against us, and lead us not into FrankerZ, but  deliver us from Odee.

 Praise the Lord and everlasting Scarra, praise
his son Qtpie, our  savior, and praise the holy
dong, it flows through us all and gives us  life. For without the
dong, man would not have conquered the bowflex,  and the world would be lost to FrankerZ.

 At the table, Qtpie took the bread, gave thanks and said "take t
his  all of


you, t
his is my body, it has been given up for


you. Do t
his in  memory of me." When supper was finished, Qtpie took the cup, gave thanks  and said, "take t
his and drink from it, t
his is my blood, it has been  shed for


you and for all so that


your sins may be forgiven,
do t
his in  memory of me."

 And when Qtpie looked upon summoners rift and, behold, it was corrupt; for the FrankerZ had corrupted
his way on the rift.
 (Book of Dong 6:12)

 And Qtpie said to Scarra, "The end of all minions is to come before  me; for the rift is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I  will destroy them with the
dong."
 (Book of Dong 6:13)

 And so Scarra said that it was to rain for 40 days and 40 nights, so  Qtpie gathered up all of the
dongers, FrankerZs and bowflexes, and he  build
himself a great s
hip, an arc, and it was where he would save
dognitas from the calamity.

 Qtpie, nice cock. I mean that from the bottom of my heart. You have delivered one of the greatest runs I have seen since 1978. It's been a long time since I've seen such a good spelunky melunky player, and it inspires me to plug in my Dial-up and give it a swirl myself. I just wanted to say thanks qtpie,


you've changed my life.

him a big advantage) and couldn't even
do a BLJ up the stairs past the 50 star
door, so he handed the controller to jiano and cheated...he didn't win the race still and was really salty and didn't finish the run...he didn't clap or look happy when sig was
doing
his 70 star run, and then he says t
his http://i.imgur.com/XVtB54i.png sicko is truly a scumbag and deserves to be banished from the sm64 community

 I find it funny how Loco

 Streamer


you have just made a terrible mistake. I see time depleting, splits turning red. Yet my feelings go to blue, t
his is truly heartbreaking. What appe

ared to be so good was taken right before my eyes, like the wind carries leaves from a tree t
his run has been wasted. T
his truly disappoints me and I feel the need to inform


you that t
his can no longer go on like t
his. For t
his reason I would like to tell


you RESET

 T
his is a copypasta, t
his is purely made to fill up a stream chat with a pointless paragraph, and it's
doing a good job. Now people will repost t
his copy pasta and make it one hell of a chat. They
do t
his because they find t
his funny and entertaining. However they
do not realize how they

are affecting the stream experience of other people. So
please copy and paste t
his to stop copy pasta's.

 Everybody's bugged by spam nowadays, and as if the fact that it's  annoying weren't enough, people make a profit by using spam too. That's  why anti-spam laws exist, so that spam-scammers and other scammers too  can be punished. I would HATE it if u copy pasterino'd t

 Wow. Another chat destroyed by copy pasterino. How many more terrible  streams need to be corrupted before the rest of


you Twitch viewers  realise that mods will never moderate, Copy pasta will never be  original, and that t

you copy pasted my  opinions last time I sh

ared them, but I won't stay angry, just
don't
do  it again. Peace

 Kripp, t

your 4th grade geography class. I just  wanted


you to know that I still haven't forgiven


you for what


you did to  that poor little duckling during our field trip to the CN Tower. You

are the scum of humanity but I will still fap to


you day and night  because


you have a cute butt, hun.
 sometimes i like to imagine kripp throwing me hard against a bed and  taking me forcefully over and over on our wedding night. it would be an  arranged marriage but my mind would quickly be changed once i took one  look at that pale, scraggly boney skeleton and all of my feminine juices  started flowing like a sloppy niagra falls. I was ready to become a  woman, and Kripp was going to be my master.
 guys, t
his is the finol straw. I have had it up to here with the copy  paste t

 I would like to thank Riot for having skin sales. My family

you for the skin sales, Riot.
 The only t

don't know who  have the control of that website but that is not ok. It shouldn't happen  and i t

 Hey ZFG, Dampe here. I just wanted to say that I am tired of

are a hope, a dream, an inspiration and insignia of love. When I came into t

your DotA client, the endearing copy pasterino in t

your chat has not been raising a sufficient  amount of

are going to have to shut

your chat to raise their
dongers.
 When I'm ready to go to sleep I grab my laptop and get in bed. I open my  laptop, go to Kripps


youtube, turn the brightness all the way up and  watch the video with the laptop screen close to my eyes. When the video  is
done I close my eyes and can still see Kripps face w

 Dear Fabbbyyy, I have been watc

 Seriously *** t
his. I'm
done with t
his game. Every time I come to

arena,  all I *** see is mindless opponent top decking. All those stupid cards  of my drawn and stupid cards of card choose phase. T
his will probably  the most stupid card game ever. I'm
done with t
his chat.

 Ok chat, I'm not seeing nearly enough spam in here, I mean I thought  t
his was supposed to be "the worst chat in twitch" and t
his is all


you  got!? The KPM in t
his chat is WAY too low, it is actually depressing.  How am I supposed to enjoy chat without
dongers, "FrankerZs", and the  occasional elephant?
 10 years since sing strim.i walk through the empty streets trying to  t
hink of somet
hing else but my path always leads to the stream. i st

are  at the screen for hours and try to summon the lord. i watch other asian  girls streaming but it is no good. i flame dendi in
his channel and try  to resist the nazi mods but it is all meaningless. the end is near.i  then usually watch some old sing vods and cry myself to sleep.
 Kripp, I say t
his from the very bottom of my heart. But


you seriously  need to go
die in a grease fire if


you ever make me sit through one of  those le epin maymays ever again. Seriously though, I love


you Kripp...  but i will slice


your throat open if


you even open that book again.
 Please  for the love of god Kripp just lick


your goddam knee.  I've been  sitting here for 10 hours straight watc
hing that boney *** knee of


yours  by


your big lushous mouth.  Please just fulfill t
his one wish I have  and lick that sexy *** knee of


yours so I can blow my creamy load all  over myself and slowly fall into a deep sleep.
   I really miss the early days of t
his stream when Kripp would read us  stories before he went to bed. Kripp is like a big brother to me, he was  there when my biological p

arents weren't. I love


you Kripp
 Every day, I open sovi's stream and sit
down with a 100 pack of capri  suns. I wait until the stream starts, and then it begins. I open the box  and force myself to drink the capri suns. I have stage V diabetes and  will
die soon, but I know it is what Sovitia likes. I feel at peace  knowing that it is what Sovitia would have wanted. Please no capri  sunerino.
 Dear Spooky, My name is Devilmayspy aka A
dolf Hitler. I am here to ruin


your streaming experience by banning


you for absurd reasons like disliking injustice and saying t
hings that strike me the wrong way. I am the reason people troll every stream I moderate. I am the worst t
hing in the FGC since Marn beat
dogs. Bifuteki is more respected than me. I am dirt. Please remove me from moderating duties. Sincerely, Devilmayspy
 evening Mister Burnedgoat. I'm writing


you t
his letter today because I  believe I'm a victim of mistaken identity. I was watc
hing ZFG's lovely  stream and participating in the intellectual chat. Unfortunately, just  as I was about to compliment ZFG on
his awesome dedication, I realized  my message had not been sent because I had been banned from
his chat.  T
his realization of the ban resonated throughout my soul and I wept  terribly.
 "So, what

you little bitch." Cosmo had always secretly been bisexual, but he  never told anyone. He tried to act like he wasn't excited, but he was  horny beyond

 Hey chat, hey ZFG...Reggie from Ninten
do here. I'm glad to see that


you

are enjoying one of our finer games, Ocarina of Time, but I'm going to  have to ask


you to refrain from breaking it like


you

are. You

are NOT  playing it the way we wanted


you to, and


you

are having a lot less fun  than


you could. Please consider or


your body won't be ready for the  Ninten

you Mr.Glitcha, and Game on! - Regginator
 zfg, I hope


you can see t
his message now that the chat has
died
down, u  shameful motherfucker. I'll have


you know I graduated top of my class in  Antartica; home of the greatest walruses. A week ago, I was having sex  with my
dog when it turned around and bit me. i've realized t
his, and  it's so liberating. Great job stiv. I am rooting for


you always! You  should be proud. Remember that the Bible condemns homosexuality
 copypasta is dumb (
dont copy t
his message. i know its tempting, and i  know


you might t
hink it'll be funny, but in reality, it's not)
 ZFG  I appreciate


you. You come on Twitch every day and
do what


you love,  all w
hile ignoring the chat trolls. You've proven to me that


you

are the  bigger
donger in t
his world full of raising. When


you get the world  record, I want


you to know that I will be naming my first born c
hild  after


you. "ZFGirl" or "ZFGuy". You're invited to
his or her first  birthday as well. I hope


you can make it!
 Hey  Mods, I hope


you can see t
his message now that the chat has
died
down. I  wanted to say congrats! I know it's hard to manage a TwitchTV chat but I  always want to tip my hat off to


you guys. Through t
hick and t
hin I  will still be here to always support


you. I know times

are hard, but


you  always come back with a good attitude. I wish


you the very best on


your  next timeouts, and hope


you get an even better ban score.
 so i was walking
down the road today and 2 black hoodlums approached me.  They asked "dawg u a crip or a blood fool". Startled, i muttered "I'm a  kripp". The power of morosan rushed through my body, i raised my
donger  and blew both of the hoodlums away with 100% pure orange juice from  concentrate. Value.
 Kripparrian was found dead in
his home on March 2nd. At the scene of
his  death were thousands of tissues full of cum and 100 open pornhub tabs.  It is estimated that Kripp masturbated at least 300 times per day for  the last week, resulting in
his
dong exploding and
him bleeding to  death.
    Hi Michael, its Shawndeela. We had a night of passion where


you  promised me the world. Since


you refused to use a con
dom because


you  said


your "seed must flow freely" I am now carrying our c
hild of love.  Michael
please contact me so we can raise
him as a true
donger.
 Well I regret to inform


you Kripp that


your choice to return to Path of  Poe has confirmed my suicide tonight. It had been a fun ride, but I  simply cannot afford to live any longer. Please bless me that I may rip  in paparolies, as t
his will be my fifth suicide t
his week.
 Well Kripp,


you moving to Poe of Path has made my girlfriend realise she  only loves me because we watch


your Hearthstone stream. She just left  me. Thanks a lot,
douche. Please no pasta as I am still trying to  recover from the pain.
 no mom issues. none at all actually. my mom has been brainwashed by men,  like i said patriarchal society that's pro-rape culture. i feel sorry  for women and hate the fact that i have a weapon between my legs that  has unfortunately been used to violate women by many chauvinistic rapist  men in the past. i hate being a man.
 Krippler's aim is to establish a New Order of absolute Nazi German  hegemony in the Twitch Metaverse. To t
his end,
his foreign and
domestic  policies had the aim of seizing Lebensraum ("living space") for the  Donger people. Under Krippler's rule, in 1941 German forces and their  European allies occupied most of Europe and North Africa.

          Why am I always being put in the friend zone. I'm a nice guy, work a  nice job, and would

you call it.
 My son, who suffers from mild autism, is now in
his room crying after  being called a "retard" by one of the people with a sword next to their  name, then he was issued a mute for 420 seconds. I understand these to  be the actions


your moderators. Now, I allowed
him to watch t
his stream  because it is usually very family friendly and politically correct, we  especially loved the tournament last year, but t
his is crossing the  line. I
don't know
 STOP with the fucking copypastas, it was funny when there were, maybe,  two going around. Now it's actually in
hibiting t
his community's ability  to have meaningful discussion about the game. So just stop, t
his  marathon is about SPEEDRUNNING GAMES, and the games come FIRST.
 ZFG, just stop the run. I can't stand to see


you like t
his. It's clear


your heart is not in it. Just go back to 100%
please. It's


your true  calling and


you seem so much more passionate about it.

 Riot needs to literally "Olaf" Dignitas. They have no counterplay and

are toxic to the LCS experience of the other teams. Not to mention their  kit is completely overpowered. They have game knowledge AND prime  rotations, what kind of god gets paid to coach a team like that? As long  as they exist, other teams will literally never reach worlds.

  When I  was about 13 or 14, I jizzed on a pizza by mistake w
hile masturbating  in its direction, with my p

arents and siblings upstairs. I just  masturbated in the kitchen then suddenly I had to cum. I tried to make  it to the bathroom so I could jizz on the mirror or somet
hing, but then I  fell
dongfirst into the pizza box, and came all over it. I suddenly  realized I had came on the pizza my family was going to eat so very  quickly I took some bleach wipes and wiped
down the pizza, I told my  p

arents I couldn't eat due to being full, and they ate the fucking pizza  o_O The next day or so, my mother announced she was pregnant, and gave  birth to my brother (who has mental problems) nine months later.

   Do

 Hello guys, I'm back from my 600 seconds timeout. During that time I was  able to finish my 200 words essay on the topic of Nazi Germany. My  thesis is that Hitler & Nazi beliefs

 When Kripp gets a pitten its a 12 win cotton mitten pitten. He gets so  smitten

 Hey Kripp how's it going, Hitler here. I've heard rumors that

 Hey kripp,

his hair and  I for one t
hinks he deserves the nobel prize.
 Wait a minute. I just spotted an inconsistency. Could t
his be the work  of the CIA? Look closely... below the stream. "10,000 viewers". What the  heck? There's only 7 million people in the world, how could there  possibly be 10 million viewers right now?
 "Kripp my son," say the Papparin, "

 Thank

down


your stream to save the c
hildren's ears. Get  ready to rest in pepperonis "N" word.
  I'm actually really genuinely confused as to why t

 Hello Kripparrian, t

don't repost  t
his. Thank


you.
 Kripp... seriously? T
his grim dawn garbage is a complete snooze-fest...  That game looks so terrible, and the grap

 There was once a Magnus. The weight of the world was on

his time. T
his was
his day. Blink at the ready, finger on R, he  called out to
his comrades, "Affirmative." Such is the legend of  Bangfish.
 "Minus one!" said singsing but soon the appearance of a farmed bounty  hunter brought an end to all of t

 Once upon a time, I opened a LoL game. I entered the game, and I was promptly greeted by another player. I noticed it was a female player and I was pleasantly surprised.

Yesterday we lost a good man. I'm of course talking about Paul "Scarra" Walker. He was on
his way home from raising
his
dongers when a drunk driver named Marcus "Dyrone" Hill crashed into
him. Dyrone has now been placed into custody.

I
don't get it guys, what is it about being a mod of Twitch chat that compels people to join the National Socialist party? I just
don't understand, I mean there's not

hip that makes


you want to support the second coming of the T
hird Reich, but somehow the two go hand in hand. I mean, for starters I
don't even know any German or Austrian Twitch mods, but they're somehow all fanatical National Socialists. Just baffles me is all.
'Sheever must be interviewing one of the Cloud 9 players.' she thought, as she swapped the clipboard to her left hand, and grabbed the
door handle to the C9 player room. She went on tippie-toes and peered in through the small win
dow in the
door. Inside she had a full view of Singsing thrusting repeatedly into Sheever, who was on her hands an knees, her breasts swinging back and forth, colliding with her chest with a slap. Sheever was moaning loudly, her moans slowly escalating into shouts. Singsing grabbed a fistfull of sheevers hair and pulled hard, Sheever's head snapping up.

Hello Fnatic!, it seems that

When I see Aui_2000 playing Visage or Chen, my hand unconsciously moves to my Rod of Atos. As I gently c

aress my Rod, I become in-tune with Aui. I can feel my MMR rising just by observing
his micro skills. As
his micro intensifies, I start sweating and panting uncontrollably. I cannot contain my horny level much longer. After 35 excruciating minutes of holding it in, it finally happens; an in-game purchase of Rod of Atos by Aui_2000
himself. Overcome by ecstasy, I start shouting unintelligible t
hings as my nipples explode with delight.

The bull
dog rat (Rattus nativitatis) was a species of rat endemic to Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. The rats lived on the
higher
hills and denser forests of the island. They had short tails and their backs were covered in a two centimetre t
hick layer of fat. They lived in small colonies, in burrows among the roots of trees or under hollow logs in primary forest. They were sluggish and never climbed and may have seemed half-dazed in daylight. The last record dates from 1903. They may have succumbed to a disease brought by black rats that had been inadvertently introduced by sailors.

My Name is Jacky Mao Also Known as EternalEnvy and I am a creepy guy. Some evening I was walking home and saw Arteezy kiss a girl. She was crying for help. When the girl saw me she started to
hide be
hind Arteezy back...
Yes, Arteezy's better looking than me and


younger, he definitely has better farm skills than me and has more swag and more universally preferable personality BUT after seeing that pic below the waist I must say t
his, and not to brag: he's losing to me there. Females, t
his guy may be better than me in every way, but lower, I must say he would lose against me in that department. Not just with size, but 100% of everyt
hing. Most females, if blindly choosing a man based on genitals, would DEFINITELY pick me over
him. I can say t
his with 100% certainty: he is small, flacid, and not as aesthetically pleasing as me. He wins the pretty boy awards, but he can't win the real "prizefighter." so la
dies know that there's no one better in that department than me, FearDarkness.
Arteezy if


you're here right now reading t
his I want


you to know I dream of


you. Sometimes I sit alone in my bathroom with the light off and pretend to be


you. I'll say t
hings like "'we lost boys" and pretend to bottle crow, and for a brief moment I feel


you inside me...
i t
hink Arteezy have insanely good micro and he is having huge impact on a games he playing if
his teammates giving
him space . I believe if Arteezy going to focus hard on improving and respecting
his enemies he will be for sure one of the best players in future . Only t
hing he lack right now in my opinion - is experience . But t
his is not a problem and will come in some time . As a player i like
him a lot . But the music on
his stream is horrible !
Arteezy, why

are


you so cruel to


your girlfriend. Didn't


you just see EE-sama talking to


you, asking


you to unmute mumble so


you can play the game together? It makes me sick that girrls go after jerks like


you, and not nice guys like me.
I owe my life to Arteezy. I got in a horrible car crash and i was in 6 month coma. The nurse switched to the Twitch channel to Arteezy's stream. I awoke from my coma and muted it.
It's happening, my nipples

are hard, i gently take my schnitzel out
of my pants w
hile i watch Arteezy go mid and build a Midas. 40 minutes have passed, Arteezy keeps farming non-stop making max
usage of the precious midas, he's the top farmer, i start speeding up fapping gradually. Rtz now 6
sloted. Finally he goes fight 1v5. Enemies starts to go
down...
one kill,
double kill, ultra, RAMPAGE, boy juice starts pumping up my schnitzel w
hile arteezy
all chats about
his rampage and ixmike congratulates
him with a "grats".
Arteezy sat in a dark room. The words "Dire Victory" filled up the screen. Not even Arteezy's sha
dow fiend could win t
his game. 3/8/7 378 GPM. Tears filled Arteezy's eyes as he carassed
his hand of midas. The sound of hard core gangster rap and crying filled the room. The
door creaks open and EE-sama enters the room. "You lost Artour." "You
do know what happens when


you lose." Arteezy removed
his clothes, wearing only one of EE's anime wigs. EE removed
his clothes, "You lost 23 MM. Thats how many hours


your punishment will be." Arteezy spent the next 23 hours being furiously fucked by
his mentor. After the punishment the semen covered Arteezy arised. "Thank


you master, I can't wait to return the favor when


you lose." Envy smiled. "So will I Artour."
Last night I had a dream that whenever I typed somet
hing in Forsen's channel, everyone copied and pasted it, and then Forsen got really mad at me for starting spam. After that he banned me and I felt really bad for it, so my only option to apologize to
him was to suck
his sweadish meatballs. Sorry Forskin!

The Rumor Come Out: Does MoonMoon is Gay?MoonMoon is gay is the most discussed in the Twitch in the few years ago. Even it has happened in 2016, but some of the Twitch still curious about what is exactly happening and to be the reason there is a rumor comes out about
his gay. At that time MoonMoon became the massive social networking rumor. The Twitch, especially
his chat

are shocked. MoonMoon just came out with
his bad rumor w
hich is spread massively.
The year is 2025. MoonMoon_Ow lies on
his deathbed, the countless years of oatmeal infighting finally having taken their toll. He struggles to adjust
his eyes to the gl

are of
his computer screen, yearning to view
his beloved twitch chat one more time. All he sees is degenerate weeb spam. His eyes brim with tears. He begins gasping
his final breath, and in
his final moments he
hits the hardest dab known to humanity
wow qt is such a good guy <3 w
hile most people

are spending new years with their friends and family, t
his legend is feeding the hungry on the rift. much love brother and happy new year.
My $0.99 starter bundle put me well above the other players. But, when I reached the first enemy castle. I couldn't beat it. I checked the in game shop. "BONUS SILVER TROOPS $4.99 EXPIRES IN 3:14:28" I happily spent $4.99. Shortly after I came across an elite boss I couldnt beat. So I checked the in game shop. "BONUS GOLD TROOPS. 5000 RESOURCES. $19.99 EXPIRES IN 1:05:39" It's about to expire! I quickly entered my credit card and bought the bundle, it was such a steal. I love Art of Conquest!
Wow guys, enabling bttv gif emotes was by far the worst decision of my life. Is spamming chat with these annoying  emotes really the only t

"Give me a second, guys," Kripp says. "Gotta
hit up the bathroom" He turns
down the volume on
his microphone, and immediately gives Dex a swift kick
down the stairs. As Dex yelps loudly in pain, Kripp overturns the ne

arest chair, yelling "Fuck t
his game!" as loudly as he can. Rania tries to calm
him
down, but Kripp swiftly bodyslams her onto a glass coffee table. After taking a few deep breaths, Kripp wipes the blood off of
his face, sits back
down at
his computer, and resumes
his stream.
As Jeff Kaplan st

ares at me through my computer screen, I begin to contemplate reality. What truly has substance in t
his realm of technology, avarice and sin? What is our future, if not a blank, hollow not
hing, rife with silence and strife?
Why
do so many people watch t
his washed up player? He is so bad at t
his game. Why is
his hair so long? Does hair length have a connection to a players skill? Is that why girls

are so bad at league?
You know what's worse than Ajit Pai? To access the punchline to t
his joke,


you must purchase the Punchline Package for $14.99
You must pay for the Social Media Package with


your internet service provider to view t

his deathbed,
his organs absolutely ravaged from years of veganism. He turns to
his computer monitor for one last look at
his beloved twitch chat only to see a bunch of weebs, emote spam and copy pasta. Tears fill
his lifeless, vegan eyes. Rania is at

Today my 12 year old son and I walked into harvard to sign
him up for college. The dean rudly asked what a 12 year old was
doing signing up for such a prestigious institute like harvard. My son took of to reveal
his Rick and Morty s
hirt and proclaimed "Well


you see sir I watch Rick and Morty". A look of confusion came over the deans face and I have never been so proud. The dean quickly made sure to appologize to my son but it was too late, the police rushed in and dragged
him out. My son passed all
his classes with 4.0s and graduated top of
his class in the first day of college.
When I was in school I used to have an IQ of 15. My classmates used to harass me for not being that smart. But since 2013, my life has changed. My IQ is now 195 and it increases by 5 every time I sit
down on Saturday nights to watch t
his one show. It is called Rick and Morty. Because of that, I get all the girls and people

are always comparing me to Albert Einstein, some even say that I am the cure for cancer. When the government found out that I watch Rick and Morty, they showed up to my residence and took me to a secret facility to take an exam. The exam was about explaining all the jokes in Rick and Morty and I had to answer each question in all currently spoken languages. Since I watched Rick and Morty, I didn't have any problems and I completed it in 30 minutes. The next day, I got to see the results and I passed the exam with a score of 100%. They gave me the title "Smartest Man in Existence". Guess I am out of t
his world.
You see, I have a very
high IQ. Do


you want to know why? Well, I'll tell


you anyways, I have a
high IQ because I watch t
his amazing television show (w
hich to my surprise piqued my interest unlike many other television shows) Rick and Morty. T
his show is remarkably intellectual (Like me, mind


you) and not like any other animated shows. My most favorite joke from the show is "WUBALUBADUBDUB" it makes me giddy inside and knowing the common folk wont understand the joke makes me laugh even harder!
Hi I'm 13 and I just started watc
hing Rick and Morty and I can tell


you for a fact it's my favorite show!!. Lik the one time Ricky said said there's probably like no good !!!! i was agreeing so much I'am smarter then


you're average fidget spinner teen at middle school to even though I have one. I may be


young but I'm smarter then every theist on earth basically the show is also really deep when they said like no one was born for a reason I was so blown away as they must have big balls to say that on tv so I told my friends on minecraft and they agree too. LOL once when my mom took me to McDonald's I asked for the Mulan dipping sauce and the dumb bitch didn't even get the reference XD One time in class i evan shouted "I'm PICKLE RIIIICK!" and Mrs.Janice told me to go outside i fucking hate that cunt school is for dumb ppl just like what Rick said, i m too smart for such imbicells. But yeah I love Rick and Morty and I'm actually smart enough to get it to.
I pretended to be a girl in csgo competitive matchmaking. At first we just played csgo together, but we worked up to more. I even skyped dressed as a sexy woman "with poor connection" so the video would blur. After many seductive photos of my ass in my sisters underwear I convinced
him I was the real deal. It took me 3 weeks to become
his girlfriend. Eventually I scammed t
his guy out of $600 because I convinced
him I would come visit if he paid for the flight. I was lucky it paid off because i had spent nearly $200 on make up to pull off t
his con. He also gifted me over 20 games on steam. 11/10 would
do again. It was actually a nice weekend when I flew to visit
him and didn't even mind sucking cock. We're looking to move in together in October.
Teenagers and man c
hildren according to who? You? What is


your standard? I'm a fan of Rick and Morty, and I've been watc

are scientists love the show, because it has a sense of humor and plot lines that


you need a STEM mind simply to follow, let alone interpret and appreciate. Most of the people who diss the show

are standard literature, p
hilosophy, sociology a business majors who would rather watch s
hit like The Office or How I Met Your Mother and other s

Just shut the fuck up. T

hing w
hich is popular, and therefore popular to s
hit on among the contrarians on Reddit. Come on, really. I actually
do have to wonder about the IQs of people who like that pretentious copypasta. You know, I sometimes can't help but superiorly smirk as I imagine their dumb faces struggling to understand words on a mere internet webpage. In fact, I sometimes find myself in paroxysms of ironic Schadenfreude as I envision the visages of the aforementioned Slow-in-the-minds waging war with the Cultural Artifact they proclaim to be analyzing, only to fall, slack-jawed, back into their insensate stupor, the proverbial Undiscovered Country, "from whose bourn no traveler returns" .
My teacher said to my I'm a failure, that I'll never amount to anyt

him. Shocked, my teacher asked what's so funny, my future is on the line. "Well...


you see professor" I say as the teacher prep

ares to laugh at my answer, rebuttal at hand. "I watch Rick and Morty." The class is shocked, they merely watch pleb shows like the big bang theory to feign intelligence, not grasping the humor. "...how? I can't even understand it's sheer nuance and subtlety." "Well


you see...WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB!" One line student laughs in the back, I turn to see a who t

are ones that

It was dinner time at the Overwatch GAYmer house. Moonmoon dishes up a steamy plate of pasta when he realizes he forgot the meat. Seagull looks up from

his sausage into moonmoons tight lightly buttered dinner roll. The scream of delight, Seagull releases
his load, calling an end to yet another successful team dinner

I am honestly so sick and tired of people objectifying Kripp. Like yeah I get it he's a hyper-attractive vegan with large muscles and a beautiful aesthetic but that's not the point of the stream.

dopted and I find it hard to look away from the camera but it just feels wrong. Maybe I'm just jealous

The mitochondrion (plural mitochondria) is a
double membrane-bound organelle found in all eukaryotic organisms. Some cells in some multicellular organisms may however lack them (for example, mature mammalian red blood cells). A number of unicellular organisms, such as microsporidia, parabasalids, and diplomonads, have also reduced or transformed their mitochondria into other structures. To date, only one eukaryote, Monocercomonoides, is known to have completely lost its mitochondria.

Is there any particular reason that


your subs

My daughter was born with a hearing impairment than ultimately left her deaf shortly after birth. I have been working for years to pay for a new surgery that would allow her to hear again. Today was her 8th birthday and I managed to get her what she's always wanted for her birthday, the sense of hearing. I decided to let her listen in on what Daddy has been watc
hing late at night and I turn on


your stream and what
do I hear? Silence. Now she's crying t
hinking she's deaf again, Nice job Kripp.

We

are gathered here today in memorium of the Overwatch professional player xGodSlayerx. In life, he demanded healing and better teammates who were not bitch idiot noob feeders. In death, he is an icon of Genji players everywhere. His legacy of epic zero-kill dragonblades and Blizzcon-worthy shuriken throwing skills have inspired a generation of one-trick DPS players in Masters and below. Perhaps what he needed was not heal bitch, or s

Imo moonmoon's chat is the worst. It's an endless stream of purple lady faces and various other meaningless emotes. S
hit isn't even funny. I legit stopped watc
hing moonmoon because I can't handle
his chat. I know twitch chat is fairly toxic in general but at least people actually use words to communicate in other chats. Moonmoon's minions

are so immersed in their 3 s
hitty memes that they themselves have become a meme.
The game of "s
hitpost" is a gentlemans' sport played by
high society clubs like S.M.E.G. on emoting grounds across twitch. To play, one player posts a satirical block of text to the pitch, usually with a paygated emote such as moon2SMEG . Next, the other players copy and paste the same message w
hile simultaneously laug
hing at the misfortune of the lower class.
Metal isn't so great? Are

I hate Moonmoon_ow's chat so much. All they
do is spam a stupid copy pasta or some other moronic emote and circlejerk with each other. Why can't they
do somet

I thought fidget spinning was a dumb trend, but then I got mine. I felt the spin, I felt it on my finger, I felt the rush of a good spin. It changed me. I got my spinner ironically, but I was wrong.

I despise with a burning acidic passion any streamer that isn't MOONMOON. Every night I print out an 8.5 x 11" picture of a streamer that is not MOONMOON and wipe my ass with it.Honestly, anyone who watches any streamer except forMOONMOON deserves to be tarred, and feathered, then burned at the stake. That's how fucking much I HATE stramers. (Besides MOONMOON, of course).

Is there even a vegan saltier than Kripp? And I'm referring to when Kripp gets Deathwinged in Arena (topdeck) on a 0-2 run after
his Mad Bomber missed lethal against a 1 Health Mage with an empty board, who had just used a Sha

his Bog Creeper, but not before the opponent used Flamestrike on
his board of buffed Doppelgangsters, and then one more time after he just played Onyxia (who then got Ice Lanced and then Shattered).
So I says to my friend, I says, "Where can I go to find some
high octane gaming?". He replies, "You should check out MoonMoon on Twitch. He go hard". I come watch t

you also get t
his a
dorable little 1/1 can ping t
hings but usually is too harmless to be removed. But more than the BB is just so positive. It comes on the board like "
do


you want to cast a spell?" and I'm like "yeah BB i
do want to cast a spell let's
do t
his s
hit" and when he attacks he's like "SPELLS ARE FUN" and I'm like "yeah they

are SO FUN." He
doesn't say some bulls

are fun." And it looks so happy. I mean t

does t
his is an idiot and I'm fucking retarded but I
don't c

are, I'm beautiful. I'm having these words glued all over my body. From now on I want people to refer to me as an overused sexually identification copypasta and respect my right to paste unfunny copypasta in chat. If


you can't accept me


you're funny and mentally stable and need to check


your choice of subreddits. Thank


you for being so understanding.

Ben Brode twirls
his fingers in Tyrande's soft dirty blue hair. "If I

you make Elune great again?" Tyrande asks as she starts to undress. "Just
do as I say and I'll give


you the next Dr. Boom". Tyrande prep

ares her Cockbiter Weapon. She nods as Ben Brode takes out
his 4 mana 7/7 and slams it into Tyrande's 0/5 tightwell. "BY ELUNE'S GRACE"! Tyrande screams. After Boom-botting for 3 seconds, "HAAHAAHAA! YOU HAVE BEEN PURIFIED!" Brode yells as he SCAMAZes all over Tyrande's face..
"My apologies" Kripp's opponent emotes as he casts fireball on Kripp, ending Kripps

arena run. "That guy was so lucky! He curved out every turn, had every answer and topdecked lethal!" Kripp sighs and loads up another

arena run. His opponent closes
his laptop and t
hinks "What a scrub. And now for the cherry on top" as
his opponent walks out from the other room goes up to Kripp and licks Kripp's arm. "Good
doggie" Kripp says "Here's a treat for a good
doggie".

I miss the old Voyboy, SoloQ troll Voyboy. Not playing tanks Voyboy, teamfight flanks Voyboy. I hate the new Voyboy, the never rude Voyboy, family friendly streams Voyboy, the too polite Voyboy, meta slave Voyboy, t

I miss the old Harambe. Straight from the zoo Harambe. Eating

I gotta say at that time I'd like to meet Harambe. See I invented Harambe. It wasnt any Harambes. And now i look and look around and there's no more Harambes.
There was a heated discussion among the medical experts gathered around an operating table, on w
hich laid an unconscious Romanian man in
his 30s. "The salt levels

are off the charts!" exclaimed a cardiologist. The head surgeon sighs, "I guess t
his is what


you get when


you combine a vegan
diet and a sedentary lifestyle playing a c
hildren's card game." Upon those words the body suddenly stirs, from w
hich a muted voice b

arely croaks, "Tell...Rania...not to press...the button".
 what if we all send the same message?
Kripp will never, ever click the button. The expansions will release at a faster rate than he can collect dust. Much like the contents of the briefcase in Pulp Fiction, the button is merely a carrot Kripp dangles in front of
his viewers without any intention of actually delivering. T
his is blatantly obvious - he even admits he
doesn't bother to calculate because he knows he'll never click it. We will spam t
his pasta until the button has been clicked.

Ben Brode twirls
his fingers in Anduins soft dirty blond hair. "If I
do t
his, will


you make me great again?" Anduin asks as he starts to undress. "Just
do as I say and I'll give


you the next Dr. Boom". Anduin nods as Ben Brode slams
his Temple Enforcer into Anduins 0/5 lightwell. After Boom-botting for 3 seconds, "HAAHAAHAA! YOU HAVE BEEN PURIFIED!" Brode yells as he SCAMAZes all over Anduins face.
First, some perspective. I'm a PURIFY-PRIEST player. If


you
don't know what that is, it's not important, just know it's a deck I'm very passionate about and that I've played for three years now. That's right, I've played the same deck for the years, and it's never gotten stale. Why? Because the enjoyment comes from mastering the deck, from fine tuning my decision making, my sequencing, from learning how to play around the latest and greatest shenanigans.
Purify created a strategy that revolved around trying to lose to


your opponent in one turn without requiring any cards on the board. Silencing


your own minions and battles between the players and Blizzard make an overall game of Hearthstone more fun and compelling, but spending 2 mana on a trash card in one turn is not particularly fun or interactive.
The year is 2017 - Rania is playing hardstone w
hile her puerto rican lover performs felatio on her. She queues into an UNKNOWN and instantly receives a message from the Kripp. "T
his is so unfair! It`s not my fault vegans can`t eat p*#sy! You have 30 minutes to come back home before I shoot myself and dex in the face with my vegan gun!" She aggressively slams the desk: "DAMN IT!". "Que se pasa amor" Antonio looks up perplexed, She replies: "Turn 1 go first zombie chow...".
I sexually Identify as Harambe. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of living in a gorilla enclosure at Cincinnati zoo and dragging c

I sexually identify as a priest player. Everyday I dream about flying into ranked games and conceding to rank 25 players. Call me retarded. I

you can't accept me


you're a holy-phobe and need to check


your concede privileges. Thank


you for being so understanding.
Hey guys blizzard here and we just wanted to say purify is a great card if


you combo it with ancient watcher


you spend 2 cards to get a 4 mana 4/5! t

you want even more value


you can try it with zombie chow! its a 3 mana 2/3!!!! Finally we just wanted to say we thought it would be better as a r

Local police

are baffled by a string of strange popsicle burglaries that have taken place over the past few days. The t
hief appears to be ignoring cash, jewelry, and other valuables, only taking sugary treats from the residents' freezers. Police have yet to apprehend the burglar, but have several reports of a suspicious lanky figure with poor hygiene seen near the crime scenes muttering about "value." Any further information on the popsicle bandit should be reported immediately.

"How did Kripp get 12 wins?" Ben Brode demanded at the board meeting. "You were supposed to be monitoring
him, Charlie." "Sorry, I must've fallen asleep. He was streaming some boring action-RPG earlier today." Ben Brode frowned. "The salt shortage is cutting into our profits. We're going to need a solution, quick." Sarah raised her hand. "What if we make Firelands Portal a common?"

Ben Brode here! We

are happy to announce we have finally solved an issue that has plagued Hearthstone since beta. Despite our best efforts with cards like Flamecannon and Ethereal Conjurer, Mage was still able to lose games in Arena. With the Old Gods we introduced Faceless Summoner, and yet mage's average

arena winrate was still only 75%. With the introduction of Firelands Portal, we hope to finally make Mage a viable

arena class.

 Howdy Kripp, my name is Bill and I work in the meat industry. I'm getting pretty sick and tired of all the vegan propaganda


you're spreading on t

you probably can't even lift up a hamburger with those pitiful arms of


yours. If

"I won't
do it." says Kripp."You guys

are rotten scammers selling stolen keys." The G2A dealer stands in the corner, face obscured by the sha
dows. "Are

dow, and Kripp is shocked to see it is none other than Scamaz. "I give the order, and Rania and Pupparian
die. I've already taken Cattarian as punishment. Now sign the deal." Kripp sobs as he signs, and hopes
his viewers will one day understand
his plight.

POLICE REPORT - Canadian Mounties have at last apprehended the "Romanian Salt Baron" after suspiciously salty w
hining was heard outside of a dingy apartment in Toronto. The Salt Baron, a morose, balding gypsy man, was at the time playing a c
hildren's card game when Mounties burst through the
door. The man attempted to resist by "brofisting" the officials, but
his scrawny vegan arms had no effect. The man's wife then assumed her true Succubus form and escaped into the Nether. More at 11.
I sexually identify as The Boogeymonster. Ever since I pre-ordered 50 packs the only card I dreamed of pulling was The Boogeymonster to put it in my deck, play it on turn 8, and watch it grow. Watch it get out of control as it feasts on every puny creature my horrified opponent d

BREAKING NEWS - Canadian scientists have discovered what they

are afraid of me. I've seen their true face. Diamond 2 is an extended gutter and the gutter is full of trash. And when the drains finally scab over, all the vermin, like Dom and J

ared will drown. The accumulated filth of all their missed flashes and low mechanic champions will foam up around their waists and all the annie mains and boosted monkeys will look up and shout "Save us!"... and I'll w
hisper "No."
It's the year 2094 j

ared still can't get back to challenger. Qt and
dom have trolled
him in every promo he has played for the past 80 years.
Hey Kripp, how's it going, Faeria Dev here. We noticed that


your streams

are interesting and entertaining. To fix t
his issue, we have decided to offer


you money to play our very uninteresting and boring card game that is clearly a clone of Hearthstone. We look foward to future business with


you and hope that


you can sellout out a little bit more in the future.
Faeria created a strategy that revolved around sponsoring popular streamers without requiring any enjoyable gameplay. Trying to promote new and innovative games makes an overall stream more fun and compelling, but not bothering to explain the game and leaving the chat confused during the entire stream is not particularly fun or interactive.
"Your deck is insane." Trump said, as he slipped
his feminine hand into Kripp's pants and smirked. "Are


you trying to top-deck me?" protests Kripp, as Trump blushes, the boyish figure undressed before Kripp. "Weak tempo play, Trump." The two kissed, deeply and passionately, and afterwards Trump places
his Leper Gnome into Kripp's Twisting Nether.

you see that? Every time


you comment and complain about people posting the same comments each time just adds to the incentive for people who t

his comment will turn into a *** copypasta at t
his point just because of how "funny" and "ironic" it would be to make a copypasta out of a comment complaining about copypastas.

Reynad was getting ready for
his first HTC cast. His palms were sweaty. Frodan sits next to

There is a bunch of Twitch overlords who grow batches of streamers from genetically modified eggs. When these eggs hatch and grow, they

are given their first computer and start streaming a Dora the Explorer game. As they grow up, the most popular streamers advance and

are given more complex games to stream, from CoD to Hearthstone. Each streamer lives in a small cubicle, and there

are hundreds upon hundreds of cubicles on the grounds of the Twitch Headquarters.
Here in my garage with my pasta linguini, but

Kripp is chained to the chair, sobbing as the man hacks at

Reynad layed in
his bed. Somet
hing just wasnt right. He felt cold and uncomfortable. He needed somet
hing, but what? He went out to the kitchen to see if he could find somet
hing to
do the trick. On the top shelf he found it. He laid back in bed and poured the spaghetti sauce all over
his noodle body to keep warm for the night. Reynad became
his final form, the Reynoodle.

After Reynad began using only pictures of
his forehead for
his Tinder account,
his amount of female attention increased drastically. One woman was particularly ready to hop in bed with
him. "I'm going to make so much money off of t
his t

his forehead heard her. She "disappe

 Andrey Yanuk otherwise known as Reynad has passed away t

"Well," Kripp drawled, a toothy grin splitting
his face, "I t

his opponents Huffer triggered
his effigy, creating a Nexus Champion Sarad. "Outplayed."

The average length of Kripp's stream has decreased over the past 3 years from an average length of 11 hours to the current average of 5 hours. In 2 more years, Kripp will stream for 0 hours. What's the cause? Sources say Kripp has contracted a terminal illness - Casualitis. Soon he will join Katarrian in Heaven.

As I approached the Kripp with my bulging juiced up biceps, I heard a snicker. "Soda is healt

him I can already tell the only t

him, he top decks Big Game Hunter and I am shot dead. "Who's juiced now?" smirks the Kripp.
You have just become intrigued as to what t

Reynad wakes up after the final night of Blizzcon. "Never lucky", he says. "I wouldn't say that", says a voice to
his side. Reynad rolls over and to
his surprise, it's a hot grill. "Wow! How did I manage t
his?", he asks. "You

are very persuasive", purrs the grill. "What's


your name?" Reynad asks. "Chat calls me Scamaz", Scamaz laughs as he pulls off
his wig.
Reynad ran crying out of the house. Knowing somet
hing was wrong, Frodan ran out after
him. "What's wrong?" Frodan asked Reynad. Reynad replied with tears in
his eyes, "Everyone was making fun of me." "Why?" Frodan said. Reynad b

arely eked out the words, "I can use promo code TEMPO to get 3% off of everyt
hing, except my forehead."
A long long time ago, when Kripp was noLife, he stumbled across an old woman in an alleyway after buying some lentil soup. She told Kripp to give
him the soup and in return he would find a beautiful girl. Unfortunately, Kripp didnt realize the old woman was the succubus Raina, who would eventually make
him a simple casualarrians

Sometimes when I see my opponent drop that Warsong Commander, I quickly turn my volume up to max, let go of my mouse, lean back in my chair and close my eyes. I let the sounds of w

Twitch Chat created a strategy that revolved around trying to defeat

 Hello Kripp, Cattarian here. Since I'm dead, my new family bought me sunglasses and propped me up like in that movie Weekend At Bernie's. How

Hey Kripp, I hope t

Hey QT, hey chatters!!! It's me, country-pop superstar Taylor Swift, but


you can call me Taylor Swift. Just poppin' by to ask why the streamer won't play any of my

As Quinn finished her drink, she was overcome with sadness. "Valor, I get t

I remember a time when copypasta was biting satire and prophetic indictments of contemporary Twitch chat. Copypasta when I was a


younger teenager had the potency to topple Nazi moderators
hips and revolutionize new chat epochs. Even the truncation of "copypasta" to "pasta" shows a lack of eloquence that speaks volumes. If, like me,


you

are a product of those better times and wish to see them return then speak out. Let the memers and Toucans know that real copypasta back.
Dear Kripp, I own the apple orchard outside Toronto and I am begging


you to stop drinking so much OJ. Since

It is the year 2016, the Paparrian waits patiently outside Kripp's Sellout Castle. The butler, Trump, opens the

Trump wakes up with a scream and hugs
his stuffed bear, "I just had the most awful dream, I was about to be tucked by Kibler!" Trump's bear replies, "That wasn't a dream." As Trump recoils in horror, Kibler smirks, "It seems I'm about to tuck Frump."

Can we all stop hating on Amaz for a moment? I mean, yes, he is a colossal fake cunt, moneysucking parasite, and selfish prick. But he is one of the few representations of the gay community in Hearthstone.

Missed lethal
does not exist. It is all a well planned and intelligent BM. Now, BM is a very fragile subject. Some say it is bad, some say it is good. But only the best of the best BM kings know the truth. Putting


your opponent on 1 health and ending turn is NOT missed lethal. Not using Grommash on explosive trap for lethal is NOT missed lethal. It is pure outplay and master-level BM. So, next time


you spam 'MISSED LEGAL' in chat like retards, t
hink again. Watch and learn kids,
do as the masters.
Nice job kripp! You won at a card game that requires an intense amount of skill. I pray that my sons will be like


you and win card games with the amount of skill that


you win with! If not I'll sacrifice them to RNGesus and pray that they

you!
Stop it guys, Kripp

him from the no life all day "hardcore gamer" to someone with a life and a girlfriends with tons of money. Kripp I will now unsub to

you that one day


you will come back to what


you once were and not the $$ making girl kissing gamer with a life, that is all
Hey Imaqtpie,

Kripp stop showing


your knee on the stream,
dont be like other female streamers. We

are interested in


your personality and not body.
I stayed up all night, dreaming of t
his moment. My pulse is racing. Discarded salt packets and OJ cartons

are strewn across the filthy bedroom floor. "Oh look it's another sub," says the Kripp. I am now fully erect. "Welcome to the five
dollar club, bro" I b

arely hear as a single tear runs
down my cheek w
hile Kripp's fist fills me completely with value.
When Kripp gets topdecked, it's seen as a bit of salty fun. BUT when Reynad gets a 420 YOLO Rag Pro 5000
hit to the face with 6 different minions on the board, lethal next turn, together with top-deck skill command with one mana webspinner, he's called Salt God?
As he raises
his "Bro Fist" gently against
his cam, I raise my
donger against my cam. I feel how for that moment, Kripparrian and I become one. My
donger starts to shake, and I close my eyes, letting out a small moan as our "Bro Fists" e-touches. "Kripparrian.. t
his Bro Fist is for


you" I w
hisper to myself.
Dear Kripp. You say

The year is 1945. "Hafu," Trump speaks breathlessly into the night. "Get back to the time mac
hine. We have what we need here." A foul smirk plays upon
his lips as he pockets a top-secret Nazi folder marked "Sub Mode." Lightning flashes and thunder crashes far across the German mountains. "We will see who says Tuck Frump' now," he says.
Hi, my name is Artour Babaev, I was born on south russia, in a small farm of Salt, my entire life was all about salt, I would farm salt with my father rino, in fact, my life was so full of salt, my friends named me "PPD", until some gang of Spooky Scary Skeletons killed

Dear Kripp, t

On November 10th, 2014, Octavian "Kripparian" Morosan was found to be severely delusional. He began wandering around
his home, mumbling 'brofist' and 'subscribe'. As
his weak fist was placed gently on the webcam, a single tear ran
down
his cheek. He knew he was a sellout.
My name is Octavius Kripparius Muridius, commander of the PJSalteers of the North, General of the Salty Legions and loyal servant to the TRUE emperor, Saltarrian. Father to a Flamestriked son, husband to a Top decked wife. And I will have my vengeance, in t
his stream or the next.

Trump got kicked out of Blizzcon when security asked

That's an extremely unfortunate loss Kripp, even though


you outplayed
him on every possible level he still beat


you, i've never seen anyone as unlucky as


you that match, nor anyone as lucky as he was that match. It shouldn't even be legal for someone as bad as

T
his chat is the dumbest group of people i've ever seen. I work with mentally handicapped people and i've been all over the world. I have been to beauty pageants and monster truck events. I have met a kid with an IQ of 8. I have even met President George W. Bush. But t
his chat is truly the most retarded t

Hi Kripp,

Hello Kripparian, Leon Tidewellow here, CEO of PETA. My sources tell me that


you haven't pet

Who c

ares! It is a scientific fact that the human eye cannot tell the difference. In fact i'd argue that 60 fps looks worse. 60 fps is too smooth, it's like petting a shark, the scales (frames)

are too smooth so it cuts


your hand (eyes), w
hile 30 fps is nice and stable and gives


you a better immersion because the frames travel a longer distance so the world looks bigger
Paparrian was born in Germany, the


youngest of the five c
hildren (three of whom survived) of Hanz Hector Paparrian, from a noble family of the province of Freiberg. In 1932, he began
his medical c

areer in Theo
dor Meynert's psyc
hiatric clinic at the Trollstein General Hospital. The same year, he married Mamarrian, the granddaughter of Isaac Bernays, a c
hief rabbi in Hamburg. In the summer of 1935, the couple had a beautiful and gifted c
hild: Kripp. On 15 September 1935, Hitler presented two laws who deprived so-called "non-Aryans" of the benefits of German citizens
hip. The


young p

arents, extremely afraid for the future of their beautiful c
hild, where confronted to a question that would forever change the fate of the world: was Krip Aryan?
When Cybrix buys a Pepperoni pizza, its seen as a bit of greasy fun. BUT when Kripp orders a 420 GreaseMaster Pro 5000 garbage pizza pie with 6 different types of pepperoni, spiceified sauce with non-drip collection tray, together with optional built in Cheese crust, hes called Fattarrian
How the ever loving *** is t

Dear Mr Morosan, I was unaw

are of the fact that upon subscribing to


your channel full of top notch casual gameplay, my personal rights would be violated. I did not ask to be "fisted". I hereby demand a public apology and a stack of OJ cartons as compensation for the psychological scars t
his horrible attack on my privacy has caused.
Did You Know? YAYO was first found in America in the year 1070. The native Dongers sang it to

People say Hitler is finally gone right? Well guess what, he isn't.  revived

Dear Kripp, t

Wait a minute. I just spotted an inconsistency. Could t
his be the work of the CIA? Look closely... below the stream. "10,000 viewers". What the heck? There's only 7 million people in the world, how could there possibly be 10 million viewers right now?
Dear Kripp, t

you brutally brofisted a small defenseless Kitten in its a

Pizza. Pizza. The chat's hurtful words haunt Cybrix at night as he sleeps on
his bed of bagel bites. "Why

him. Because it turns out even an obese pizzabator is more tolerable than Rick.

So I went to a Strip Club in Greece the other night and guess who i saw there. It was the Kripp with hundreds of 5
dollar bills. So the Stripper goes in a hot pose, Kripp smiles and pours
himself a glass of OJ. Kripp said "Welcome to the 5 Dollar Club" and they went into a private room. Not sure what .happened then but i guess he gave her a brofist.
Last night in Greece, Greek police heard reports of a Canadian man in a blue tacky sweater walking around the streets at night, 'brofisting' the local population. As a result 20,000 greek citizens have contracted the casualitis. If


you see t
his man,
please report to greek policerino department.

Hi guys Kripp here with VEGAN FACTS! Did


you know that milk is literally !Worse Than Hitler! and also killed many people during the Twitch Chat-ocaust in the 1940's? If

your bones will be as frail as Reynad's Rag RNG and


you'll basically be Leifman's brother. Well, that's all for today's vegan facts! Bye guys! BRO FIST!!
My dad drank milk

died of calcium deficiency. My mom told me "Dont drink milk;
dont put


your family through t

hing Kripp play Hearthstone gave me calcium deficiency anyway.
The teacher asked Kripp, "Why is

I owe my life to Cybrix. I got in a horrible car crash and i was in 6 month coma. The nurse switched to the Twitch channel to Kripp's stream. I awoke from my coma and muted Cybrix.
Romanian
doctor say in t
hick accent, "He suffer from Casualitis, too many salts in blood." OJ is injected into the Kripp, but he continues to mumble "Really bro," and "Wow," numerous times. A priest enters and rips a bag of pepperonis over the Kripp. Papparin say "Drink with me friends," and offer cappucino to all.
You guys

Hello guys, I'm back from my 200 seconds timeout. During that time I was able to finish my 200 words essay on the topic of Nazi Germany. My thesis is that Hitler & Nazi beliefs

Sometimes, whenever i eat M&Ms, i like to hold two m&ms in between my fingers and squeeze as hard as i can until one m&m cracks. I eat the cracked one and the one that didn't crack becomes champion, then i grab another m&m and force it to compete with the champion in t
his deadly game of m&m gladiators. I
do t
his until i run out of m&ms, and when there is one left standing i send a letter to m&ms brand with the champion in it and a note attached that reads "
please use t
his m&m for breeding purposes"
Every game is equally pointless. You can't put t

Once upon a time, I opened a LoL game. I entered the game, and I was promptly greeted by another player. I noticed it was a female player and I was pleasantly surprised.

Maybe
his long Journey away from the evil drug that is Hearthstone has brought moral clarity to
his life. Kripp rises up and breaks away from the shackles the succubus has locked Kripp in. Papaparrian holds the key and sets Kripp's mind free. He
swears to never go back to Greece or play Hearthstone ever again. Kripp moves back in with Papa and finally gets
his OJ sponsors
hip. The beautifully creamy wall is vibrant as Kripp uploads
his newest video in the old wonderland. "Hey guys how's it going, Kripparian here." Kripp starts up PoE again in anticipation of the new expansion being released, theory crafting builds. He is happy and filled with life each day of streaming.

All is then right with the world.

I
don't get why Kripp has to have the personality of an unflushed toilet when he streams. At least when he's in mumble we can love to hate Cybrix. And a mumblebro or two spices t

Kripp, I'm disappointed in

You guys

are ruining my twitch chat experience. I come to the twitch chat for mature conversation about the gameplay, only to be awarded with kappa faces and frankerzs. People who spam said faces need medical attention utmost. The twitch chat is serious business, and the mods should really raise their

"Kripp my son," say the Papparin, "


you

are such a large pepperoni, why

aren't


you a pizza." But the Kripp
don't respond. He elopes to Greece and runs
his hand through

his heart, Papparin commits su
doku at a Starbucks in San Bernardino with Al Pacino, no cappucino.

Krippler's aim is to establish a New Order of absolute Nazi German hegemony in the Twitch Metaverse. To t

so i was walking
down the road today and 2 black hoodlums approached me. They asked "dawg u a crip or a blood fool". Startled, i muttered "I'm a kripp". The power of morosan rushed through my body, i raised my
donger and blew both of the hoodlums away with 100% pure orange juice from concentrate. Value.

How exactly
does one get pussy w
hile living at the w

you. when


you're trying to run game on some foreign prime ministers daughter the news media catches


you smiling at her and immediately blows s
hit out if proportion speculating that


you

are somehow breaking international law with


your awkward teenage flirting, so


you have to testify before congress that


you didn't give away any top secret
documents to her and

are made to admit live on C-SPAN that


you've never even kissed a girl . Then


you get blue balls from some hot conservative girl winking at


you and flas
hing her panties under her skirt and making sexy faces and blow job motions to


you w
hile


you were going through some airport or public event, and when


you passed by and shook her hand she leans in w
hispering she is going to diddle her clit t
hinking about


you tonight and how much she wants to suck


your dick off, just to fuck with


you. Then


you try to look up some porn when


you get home just to relieve the tension but


you just know the CIA is monitoring and 3 other govornment agencies

are watc
hing


you beat off. Then


you finally break
down and Jack off in the shower w
hich sets off some fucking biohazard drain alarm and the entire place is on lock
down until they can find the source of the specimen and


you end up getting debriefed by the joint c
hiefs of staff about


your masturbatory habits and how


you almost created a national security issue with


your dick. Then wikileaks leaks


your search
history showing


you looked up penis enlargement techniques when it was actually just some click bait


you'd accidentally clicked and TYT spends all next week talking about


your supposed micro penis. So


you end up squirming a little since


you

are so wound up and being judged constantly and now people

are saying


you look like a fucking mental patient and


you start to t

you'll never get any pussy.

Edit: Wow, t
his really blew up!

Many people always ask me how I was able to get into Harvard as a 16 year old who skipped 3 grades of
high school. They t
hink I got in because of my scholarly records, but no the key is the interview.
As I sat in the Harvard Dean's office in front of the board of reviewers for my application, the Dean asks me "Why should


you be a good candidate for t
his school?" They seemed bored but I replied "Well I was born a c
hild prodigy, placed 1st in my state spelling bee for three consecutive years, I can speak eight different languages not counting Latin, play four different instruments, I skipped grades 4 through 6, and graduated my
high school as valedictorian at the age of 14. I then worked as an intern at both Telsa, and NASA." Suddenly the room burst into laughter and many of board instantly started scribbling
down "No" near the application check marks. The Dean says "Sorry but


you

are just not the type we

are looking for." But then I said "Excuse me but I wasn't finished... I watch Rick and Morty" The Dean looked at me like an idiot and said "So....?" Then I replied with a smile "And I understand all the references and subtle jokes" An audible gasp let out by the board was so loud the secretary had to come in. You could hear a pin drop and then suddenly all at once the entire board clicked their pens on the "Approved Box" and I was instantly handed a diploma and now I'm teac
hing advanced physicals there. I guess


you can say I'm pretty smart. :)

My teacher said to my I'm a failure, that I'll never amount to anyt
hing.
I scoffed at
him.
Shocked, my teacher asked what's so funny, my future is on the line.
"Well...


you see professor" I say as the teacher prep

ares to laugh at my answer, rebuttal at hand.
"I watch Rick and Morty."
The class is shocked, they merely watch pleb shows like the big bang theory to feign intelligence, not grasping the humor.
"...how? I can't even understand it's sheer nuance and subtlety."
"Well


you see...WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB!"
One line student laughs in the back, I turn to see a who t
his fellow genius is.
It's none other than Albert Einstein.

The t
hing I really like about Planes is that we learn that WWII happened in the Cars universe. W
hich means there was a Cars Hitler, a Cars holocaust, a Cars Pacific War, a Cars D-Day, a Cars nuking of Hiros
hima and Nagasaki, a Cars Rape of Nanking, a Cars Battle of Iwo Jima...
T
his leads to so many important questions, like: were the Cars Little Boy and Fat Man nukes sentient? Was it a suicide mission? Are ALL Cars nuclear weapons sentient? Did Tsar Bomba have a personality?
What kind of car was Car Hitler? A VW? A forklift?
Was there a Cars 9/11? Were the planes
hijacked, or were the planes themselves radicalized?
I could go on
Edit: I just realized a Cars 9/11 gives a whole new layer of meaning to the phrase "let's roll"

Typed out by me in one of the threads.
EDIT: Turns out t
his is the realest source.

I'm convinced that mattress/furniture stores exist in a quantum superposition of grand opening and going out of business sale.
It is both and neither at once until an observer records the state at w
hich point it becomes one or the other.
But because


you know exactly where the store is located,


you cannot know how fast it is going out of business because of


your uncertainty about its business momentum.
All around us, all the time pairs of anti-discount mattress stores and discount mattress stores

are popping into existence, forming the quantum memory foam that is the basis for the universe.  Without the pressure of t
his quantum memory foam strip malls would collapse.
We can see evidence of t
his when a pair is created such that one half is wit
hin the sales radius of a supermassive furniture store like Ikea-- one of them is pulled in and the other escapes as a Hawking mattress store.

Ok, t
his has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know


you're going to roll


your eyes, but hear me out: Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.
Here's why:
T
hink about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.
Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when


you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to


your eyes. You

aren't looking at it--


you're looking at a picture of it.
Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breec
hing charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.
And have


you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanw
hile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.
Now I know what


you're going to say: "But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they
do many times throughout the books/movies). But w
hich is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?
Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.
Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing
his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratc
hing a lightning bolt into
his rifle stock for each kill. I
don't t
hink Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape


your brains off of the trees and put


you back together after somet
hing like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave
his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope


you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.
I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick
his cig

arette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:
"Well then I guess it's a good t
hing my 1911 holds 7+1."
And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.

I'm Harambe, and t
his is my zoo enclosure. I work here with my zoo keeper and my friend, cecil the lion. Everyt
hing in here has a story and a price. One t
hing I've learned after 21 years -


you never know WHO is gonna come over that fence.

"Niggerfaggot" is ok to say because a negative times a negative is a positive. It's just basic math dude. Go back to 7th grade if


you
don't understand it but I'm going to keep bringing positivity and tolerance to the world with t
his word.

Hey, Vsauce, Michael here! Down here. But w
hich way is
down? And how much
does
down weigh? Well,
down weighs about 1/100 of a g/cm3 .  It is light, and airy, w
hich makes it a great source of insulation and buoyancy for waterbirds.  But if


you let go of
down, it falls
down. So that's w
hich way
down is, it's the direction that gravity is pulling everyt
hing. Now for someone on the other side of the Earth, my
down is their up, but where

are falling t
hings going? Why
do t
hings fall? Are they being pushed or pulled? Or, is it because of TIME  TRAVEL.

If I had a
dollar for every gender, I'd only have 2 bucks and millions of illegal counterfeit
dollar bills that only bring sadness and disappointment in the human race and

are a scar on the face of earth, ruining and vandalising every-fucking-t
hing the human race has strived for.

Hey guys I'm not gay, I play football. I accidentally clicked t
his thread because I thought my mouse was hovered over the hot girls thread. Well, since I'm here I had a question let's say hypothetically I had gay thoughts (lol yea right) and I found my close friend attractive (ew gross) and one day we had sex in the back of my car after football practice (I would puke...the only t
hing I bang is c
hicks with big tits


you know what I'm saying lol) but we didn't kiss. Would that be gay? We were wasted and w
hile we were banging we kept calling each other fags. It's almost like a parody of when we bang c
hicks (remember t
his didn't happen). So that wouldn't make me gay right? Just a jokester?

You know what? I'll have


you know that when I'm at max strength, I can break a bone in


your body with ONE PUNCH. Seriously, ask my brother.

All right, so if instead of an "additionally calculated" Destroy Dick December (w
hich means 1 nuts
+ 2 nuts
+ 3 nuts, etc.), we did a "factorially calculated" one (that I will officially refer to as Mutilate Member Month), it would be "1!
+ 2!
+ 3!
+ 4!
+ 5!
+ 6!
+ 7!
+ 8!
+ 9!
+ 10!
+ 11!
+ 12!
+ 13!
+ 14!
+ 15!
+ 16!
+ 17!
+ 18!
+ 19!
+ 20!
+ 21!
+ 22!
+ 23!
+ 24!
+ 25!
+ 26!
+ 27!
+ 28!
+ 29!
+ 30!
+ 31!".
T
his means that the total amount of nutting


you would need to
do during the Mutilate Member Month is 8,497,249,472,648,064,951,935,266,660,940,313 nuts.
31 days equals to 2,678,400,000 milliseconds, so


you would need to bust 3,172,509,510,397,276,341,074,995 fat nuts every millisecond to properly complete the challenge in time.

Actually, futa can be made less gay than straight porn. You see, straight porn has one guy and one girl. Because


you're fapping to somet
hing with one guy in it, that's 50% gay. If


you watch futa fuck a girl, that's one girl and a half girl, thus only 25% gay. You could make it 0% gay with two girls but the problem is, that makes them lesbian, w
hich wraps back to being 100% gay.

It simply is not true? I know, butterflies, more important than 300 deaths w
hich

are based on the number of
high school, I have peace.
Monkeys trained to fight, and I'm not a military sniper. You anyt
hing, but it was not. We wanted to determine the sex. I mean, I see the face of the earth.
If


you t
hink


you can find somet
hing on the Internet? Evo cars. Be prep

ared for
hidden spy network in the United States to attack the larvae of intellectual property rights, I must say better. The storm destroyed painful memories. Half of the c
hildren
died. You can
do it anywhere and I can already killed hundreds of hands.
T
his is wrong, but smaller oil reserves, like an old man "that some phones Navy to play ugly."
But now we can not pay ridiculous prices. I

i am a gay man and i accidentally masturbated to straight porn. i was browsing a gay porn site, so


you know, i figured there wouldn't be any women in my gay porn. i found one video whose thumbnail looked promising so i clicked on it and it started mid-sex. the bottom was face
down into the bed in some black lace dress. that should have been a big warning sign, but i assumed it was some sissy fetish t
hing. not my cup of tea, but the top was hot and really going to town on her so i stuck around.
after the guy (and i) finished, the girl sat up and that's when i saw it... her tits.


you should have seen my face. a visage of true terror. i just sat there in shock, contemplating what i had just
done. when i broke free of my stupor, i w
hispered "no hetero" but i fear it wasn't enough

Hi I'm 13 and I just started watc
hing Rick and Morty and I can tell


you for a fact it's my favorite show!!. Lik the one time Ricky said said there's probably like no good !!!! i was agreeing so much I'am smarter then


you're average fidget spinner teen at middle school to even though I have one. I may be


young but I'm smarter then every theist on earth basically the show is also really deep when they said like no one was born for a reason I was so blown away as they must have big balls to say that on tv so I told my friends on minecraft and they agree too. LOL once when my mom took me to McDonald's I asked for the Mulan dipping sauce and the dumb bitch didn't even get the reference XD One time in class i evan shouted "I'm PICKLE RIIIICK!" and Mrs.Janice told me to go outside i fucking hate that cunt school is for dumb ppl just like what Rick said, i m too smart for such imbicells. But yeah I love Rick and Morty and I'm actually smart enough to get it to.

It has been 4 hours since I successfully sucked my own penis. T
hings

are different now. As soon as mouth-to-penis contact was made I felt a shockwave through my body. I have reason to believe I have super strength and telekinesis now.. 3 hours after contact I noticed a van parked on my street but no one has entered or exited the car since its arrival. I fear for my safety, I'm not sure what sort of power I may have stumbled upon but it's possible that the government has found out. If I
don't update t
his again
please send help.

"I have to say a lot of people have been asking t
his question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me and they ask me. They say, "What's 2+2"? And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math


you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if


you want to know what 2+2 is,
do


you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell


you.
First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros be
hind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I
don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, "10101000101", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I
don't know. I mean,


you know.
So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did


you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they
don't tell


you that, and I'll tell


you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell


you. So, we're gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me. OK? Alright.
"We gonna knock the hell out of ISIS, believe me,"
Thank You, Thank


you, Thank


you.

Ok, t
his is ABSOLUTE fucking bulls
hit. I went to see Cars in the theater yesterday, and when Lightning McQueen got HOT with Sally in Radiator Springs, my boner engaged. When Lightning McQueen said "Ka-Chow!", I couldn't help it!!! I closed my eyes, and I TORE my dick to shreds, using w
hip like motions and pulled with great force. That was one of the best nuts I ever had, just t
hinking about it now gets me riled up. T
hing is, I nutted all over the kid sitting right next to me, and
his mom got all pissed at me, screaming at me for jacking off on her son. I told that bitch to shut the fuck up, and that jacking off is a natural, artistic, and beautiful process. You should BE HAPPY that my semen is all over


your son, maybe he can learn a lesson or two about the culture and art of jacking off. HOWEVER, the movie theater managers didn't agree with me. They KICKED ME OUT of the movie theater, and I didn't even finish watc
hing the Cars movie. Not only THAT, but they made me clean up my semen after it already dried out and solidified on the seats. THATS TORTURE!! Do


you know how hard it is to clean semen after its dried out? You CLEAN semen after its FRESH out of


your cock, not an hour after


you fucking nutted. T
his is a fucking OUTRAGE. Do


you really expect me to not w
hip out my cock and jack off when i see a HOT sex scene in a movie? Either
don't ban sex scenes in movies, or LET ME jack off in


your theater, assholes.

When


you step into the Rick and Morty fan
dom realm,


you're not going any old place. You're coming to the underground fight club of intellect. Prep

are to be mentally battered. But
don't worry, after


you've spent


your newbie time being cognitively pummeled,


you'll have joined the ranks of the mental elite.
Then


you'll see the world for what it truly is. All those people going around without a thought in their head. You'll hate it. You'll become just like
him. And


you'll start loving it. The power of intelligence, of absolute intellectual superiority. It'll become a
high


you chase, constantly learning and experimenting.
You'll finally be a Rick.

My typical bad Typing

EDIT: T

his, however cummy won't change it. If


you need me to paste it in the comments, request it and I will pass asap (as soon as I can).
We at Americans For Purity hope that


you never have to deal with the tragic heartbreak of a c
hild who Masturbates. But the sad fact is, Masturbation is rampant among today's


youth. The first step towards dealing with a problem is to recognize that the problem exists. Here

are some of the most common warning signs that


your c
hild may be Masturbating.

Does


your teenager have acne? Masturbation often leads to excessive hormone production, w
hich is the cause of acne. Very few teenagers who
don't Masturbate have acne.
Is


your teenager depressed? If a teenager acts sullen, withdrawn or unhappy the most likely cause is Chronic Masturbation.
Does


your c
hild lock
his or her bedroom
door? It is not healthy for a teen to want privacy. Chances

are he or she is in there Masturbating!
Does


your c
hild listen to "Rock And Roll" music? If a teenager has rebelled against God far enough to listen to the Devil's music, then he or she has almost certainly rebelled enough to try Masturbation.
Are there semen stains on


your son's bed sheets or underwear? There's only one way they could have gotten there! Line up all of


your sons at least twice a day for a family Prayer Meeting and Underwear Check!
Does


your teenager have Liberal political opinions? The weakness of mind brought on by Self-Abuse often leads to left-wing sympat
hies.
Does


your c
hild wear fas
hionable clot
hing or hairstyles? If


your c
hild can't resist the peer pressure to look a certain way, he or she probably can't resist the peer pressure to Masturbate, either.
Does


your c
hild look guilty or deny Masturbating? Very few teenagers will openly admit to Masturbating!
Have


you caught


your c
hild Masturbating? If


you walk into


your son's bedroom without knocking and he's in there with
his pants
down holding
his erect penis, he's probably Masturbating.

Preventing and Treating Teen Masturbation
If


your c
hild Masturbates, there

are steps


you can take to stop the problem. If


your c
hild
doesn't Masturbate, there

are t
hings


you can
do to prevent it.
1. Remove


your c
hild's bedroom
door. Privacy is one of the leading causes of Masturbation.
2. Monitor


your family's use of the restroom. Not only will t
his prevent Masturbation, it will prep

are


your teens for today's workplace, where corporations

are stepping up their surveillance of employees' bathroom usage.
3. Kill


your television. There is absolutely not
hing of value on television. Everyone should be reading their Bibles or working, not watc
hing filth like Baywatch or Star Trek.
4. Control


your c
hild's reading material. Screen everyt
hing


your c
hild brings into the house. Do not allow anyt
hing even remotely stimulating. Get up early in the morning and go through the newspaper cutting out all of the pictures in the Underwear ads. Burn them before


your teenager wakes up.
5. Be sensible about the music


your c
hild listens to. There is hardly any music in existence that is really suitable, because anyt
hing with a "Rock," "Country" or "Gospel" beat to it (even if it is labeled "Christian!") is designed to incite sexual desire and summon demons from the Pit of Hell straight into


your nice little Suburban home! (We have
documentation on file for those of


you who
don't believe t
his.) Practically all music CDs, tapes or MP3 files in


your c
hild's possession must be destroyed, especially if they

are by pornograp
hic "Rap" artists such as Garth Brooks, Britney Spears or 'NSync. If


you collaborate with


your fellow Church-goers on t
his, the event can turn into a huge, festive Bonfire and prayer meeting!
6. Use corporal punishment. Sp

are the rod and spoil the c
hild! Although outlawed by Socialists in many places, a good, sound thras
hing has always been the best cure for the unruly c
hild.
7. Buy and use commercially available Anti-Masturbation devices. You can get one for


your Boys by clicking here. President Bush has made it one of the goals of
his Faith-Based Initiative to fund private Christian companies to develop an effective anti-Masturbation device for Girls.
8. Understand


your c
hild's language. There

are
dozens of slang terms for Masturbation in use by today's teenagers. You should be familiar with them. Click here for a list. There

are many other lists available on the Web. Don't use these slang terms around


your c
hildren! If


you must refer to Masturbation, use the term "Self-Abuse."
9. Scientifically test


your c
hildren for signs of Masturbation. The same Liberal naysayers who insist we can't build a Missile S
hield scoffed until they were bleeding when I revealed that Scientists were hard at work on an aerosol spray that would reveal signs of Masturbation in


your c
hildren, but it's here! CheckMate scientifically detects a protein Enzyme produced by the male Prostate Gland to reveal traces of semen on clot
hing, sheets, ceilings, keyboards, etc. It app

arently won't detect Masturbation in girls (my Scientific consultants assure me that females have no prostate glands, although the Bible suggests otherwise), but will uncover sexual activity in


your daughters by detecting traces of semen in Panties, hair, etc. For additional security,


you may easily buy a $10.00 microscope from Toys R Us and a $500.00 centrifuge from Fisher Scientific that will enable


you (MALE CHRISTIAN PARENTS ONLY!!!!) to examine


your sons' urine for signs of the Sin of Onan. The slightest decline in a boy's Urinary Spermatozoa Count should be met with instant and total humiliation (and hospitalization if possible).
10. Make


your daughters grow their fingernails as long as possible. Many Christian p

arents will measure their daughters' fingernails every week and pay them an allowance based on the combined length. The reason for t
his is that long fingernails interfere not only with female masturbation, but with Lesbian sexual activity. They will also facilitate the "sniff test" for those of


you who use it to monitor


your daughter's sexual activities.
11. Put boxing gloves on


your c
hildren's hands at bedtime. Boxing gloves

are pretty hard to take off without someone's help. If


you
do t
his


you can sleep soundly, knowing that


your c
hildren

aren't touc
hing themselves in an impure way.

The waiter says "Say When", grating the parmesan cheese over my pizza. Foolish mistake. Anyone should know that there is no "when". As parmesan fills the restaurant, the pizza only gets better. After only an hour, the restaurants interior its completely filled with parmesan, killing twenty. But the resuraunt is only the beginning. Next the USA will be taken by parmesan, a force stronger than anyone could have anticipated. After that comes the world. Consider t
his a warning, to get to a foreign planet immediately. At least that will provide temporary safety, until the parmesan rises to mars. At that point, there will be enough cheese on my pizza, and I will be ready to eat.

You wanna know what the dumbest creature on t
his fucking planet is? Moths. Let me tell


you how fucking dumb these idiots

are. They

are nocturnal meaning they only come out at night but when they
do they

are attracted to light. Let that sink in. They come out in the dark... and the obsess over light. You fucking morons, haven't


you heard of t
his t
hing called the sun? God I hate those stupid motherfuckers.

There's no such t
hing as "racism" and that's a FACT. My little boy Justin has a nigger friend in preschool and he is a pure w
hite kid with good Christian blood. Justin plays with that negro every day even though I have read some news stories to
him that tells about negro rapists. Justin is a smart nigger loving kid and as a good American father, I'm not going to take
his nigger friend away from
him. Hope Y'all learn a lesson here and let those niggers be free even though they might rape


you but that's just a part of their culture.

My best friend and I got married so we could have better health insurance and work benefits. We sometimes give each other brojobs because men need release,


you know?
Eventually a
dopted a kid to be our bro. We raise
him like our own and we're all really cool with each other.
But the other night we were going at each other and our balls touched and he didn't say "no homo". Did I marry a gay guy?

According to one user on /r/copypasta:

I did the math and research. According to Wikipedia, the average length of a penis varies from 5.1 to 5.9 inches. I went for a safe 5.5 inches for an average. The average radius from the core center of the penis to the skin on the outside is .75 inches. From t
his we can roughly find the volume with pi timed radius squ

ared times height. T
his comes around as the average penis being around 9.72 cubic inches. Next I found the volume of the average human adult male. I had to first find the weight, w
hich according to Alex Schlessingerman's "The Physics Factbook" is 70kg or 154 pounds. Weight is found by multiplying an object mass by the force of gravity, 9.81 meters per second. After taking gravity out of the equation, the average mass of an adult human male is 7.14 kg. I then found the volume by dividing t
his number by the average density of a human, according to Wikipedia, 985 kg per meter cubed. The volume of the adult male was then found to be .0072516316 cubic meters. Utilizing the volume of the average penis I found earlier, 9.72 in cubed, I get .0001592828 meters cubed. T
his means the penis is 2.19% of an adult male's volume. Assuming a lack of testosterone or female hormones makes the person a female, balls ignored for ease, fucking a trap is only 2.19% homosexual.

And if t
his user is also correct:

Actually, futa can be made less gay than straight porn. You see, straight porn has one guy and one girl. Because


you're fapping to somet
hing with one guy in it, that's 50% gay. If


you watch futa fuck a girl, that's one girl and a half girl, thus only 25% gay. You could make it 0% gay with two girls but the problem is, that makes them lesbian, w
hich wraps back to being 100% gay.

we can assume that trap on woman would be only ~1% gay, because the 2 percent and 0 percent balance. But to tip the scales,


you want to also have as MANY women as possible.
With the average penis having a surface

area of 175 cm2 and the average fingertip having 4cm2 surface

area we can easily get 43 fingers touc
hing one dick, perhaps 44 if we're lucky. So that's .02/45, with .02 being the amount of penis. T
his being said, 1 trap being touched specifically on the penis by 44 women who

are not touc
hing eachother would only be 0.044444444% gay. Minimum gayness has been ac
hieved.
A counter argument would be that female masturbation, w
hich contains only 1 woman, would be the least gay. I t
hink those who support t
his idea forget that masturbation is homosexual incest. So with that being excluded, t
his is the least gay porn can be.

"Rick and Morty"? Only a plebeian worm such as


yourself would engage in viewing broadcasts of such a sad and idiotic show. Unlike


you low IQ apes, I
please my optical sensors with only the finest of entertainment. I'll bet that


you're inquiring as to what source of entertainment I am referring to. Although I
don't expect


you to comprehend it, the television show in question is "Young Shel
don". You see, the humor is vastly superior to that of "Rick and Morty". First of all "Rick and Morty" relies heavily on improvisional comedy, w
hile the intellectual humor of "Young Shel
don" is scripted and well thought out before being presented to an au
dience. Second of all "Rick and Morty" is extremely unfaithful to its source material (Back to the Future, for


you simpletons) w
hile "Young Shel
don" is just as good if not better than watc
hing "The Big Bang Theory". I could go on and on about how "Rick and Morty" is vastly inferior to "Young Shel
don" but I
highly
doubt that


you have the mental capability to process such logic. So if


you'll excuse me, I'm going to pour a glass of brandy w
hilst I redigest the latest episode of "Young Shel
don" so I can make an entry about it to the "Young Shel
don" wikia. Hopefully, I can forget about ever having the displeasure of interacting with


you.*Sighs... How tedious.

I know that a lot of people want to catch em' all, but my job is a much bigger challenge. It is my goal to masturbate to all 807 Pokemon, plain and simple. I usually try to
do it twice a day, regardless of the difficulties. At the end, I always win. I go on places like Deviantart, rule 34 and, occasionally e621 in order to ac
hieve t
his massive goal, and when I finally
do, I will become a Pokemon Master. Sometimes, it is easy. I can come in five minutes looking at Gardevoir or Lopunny pornos. Sometimes I come across major challenges that I have to overcome, in the case of Garbo
dor and Magikarp especially. I have to imagine the wet, sloppy fish mouth sucking on my cock without t
hinking about the actual fish itself. It is very hard, but the satisfaction


you get when


you ac
hieve victory is immense. Not only
do


you get the generally pleasurable feeling from ejaculation, but


you also know that


you overcame an obstacle few men have d

ared to try. I have a total of 347 successful ejaculations total, but it only gets harder as I move on. When I see a Serperior, for instance, I have to t
hink to myself "In what way can I imagine t
his creature in order to get off to it?" It is a puzzle for sure, considering I
do not have a t
hing for (most) of these creatures, making it extremely entertaining and interesting for others to watch. I try to focus in on its somewhat beautiful face, and t
hink about that more than the yards of snake be
hind it. I sometimes have issues with Pokemon like Machamp, who appear extremely male. But I always find a way. There has been no hurdle too steep for me. I want to be the very best. Anyt
hing lower
does not cut it. And that is why I am beating off to pictures of Lucario on the Internet, mom.

I was offered sex with a 21 year old girl today. In exchange, I was supposed to advertise some kind of bathroom cleaner. Of course I declined, because I am a person with
high moral standards and strong willpower. Just as strong as Ajax, the super strong bathroom cleaner. Now available with scented lemon or vanilla.

Here's the t
hing. You said a "pupper is a
doggo."
Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.
As someone who is a scientist who stu
dies puppers,
doggos, yappers, and even woofers, I am telling


you, specifically, in
doggology, no one calls puppers
doggos. If


you want to be "specific" like


you said, then


you shouldn't either. They're not the same t
hing.
If


you're saying "
doggo family"


you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Doggodaemous, w
hich includes t
hings from sub woofers to bir
dos to sharkos (the glub glub kind not the bork bork kind).
So


your reasoning for calling a pupper a
doggo is because ran
dom people "call the small yip yip ones
doggos?" Let's get penguos and turkos in there, then, too.
Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A pupper is a pupper and a member of the
doggo family. But that's not what


you said. You said a pupper is a
doggo, w
hich is not true unless


you're okay with calling all members of the
doggo family
doggos, w
hich means


you'd call piggos, sluggos, and other species
doggos, too. W
hich


you said


you
don't.
It's okay to just admit


you're wrong,


you know?

Is t
his incest?
Okay, I
don't know if t
his is actually incest since it wasn't somet
hing actually sexual in the technical sense but here goes.
When I was little my mom used to put a buttplug in me (w
hich she called a poop plug) and I'd wear it all the time. I was told only to take it out to poop, wipe my ***, then put it back in.
I was really


young so I thought t
his was just somet
hing everybody did but one time at school I dropped it when I flushed the toilet and it ended up getting flushed. So when I went back to class I told my teacher that my poop plug got flushed
down the toilet. She had no idea what I was talking about so she sent me to the school nurse.
Well after trying to explain what a poop plug was for 15 minutes the school calls the police. The police ask me all these questions and at first I'm sc

ared because I t
hink I'm in trouble for losing my poop plug.
Turns out my mom has sc
hizophrenia and was making me wear t
his ********* so Satan couldn't stick
his cock in my pooper and make me gay.

I miss the old Harambe. Straight from the zoo Harambe. Eating
his food Harambe. No attitude Harambe. I hate the new Harambe. Shot by a dude Harambe. The Youtube views Harambe. Up in the news Harambe. I miss the sweet Harambe. Playing with kids Harambe. I gotta say at that time I'd like to meet Harambe. See I invented Harambe. It wasnt any Harambes. And now i look and look around and there's no more Harambes. I used to love Harambe. I used to love Harambe. I even had the silverback I thought I was Harambe. What if Harambe made a song about Harambe. Called "I miss the old Harambe", man that would be so Harambe. That's all it was Harambe. We still love Harambe. And I love


you like Harambe loves toddlers.

So there's a c
hick in my class I like; unfrotunately im quiet, calculated and intelligent and she likes big dumb jocks. So anyway one day me and her boyfriend

are walking among a group of our felow students when a gang banger appears and threatens with a gun. Her 'big and though' boyfriend instantly freezes and loses the ability to speak. I on the other hand squint my eyes and step forward pulling my katana for ju
do practise out in one fell swoop. "Go ahead" I say. The gun is only 400 years old w
hile the sword is the c
hild of many millenia. Do


you fancy the odds?" Instantly the gang-banger drops
his weapon and runs. My other classmates cheer w
hile her jock boyfriend pretends the whole t
hing was funny. She looks at me and sees what she didnt see before. She thanks me with a kiss, but I
don't smile because I was only
doing my duty. Safe to say she saw who a real man was that day. I may be quiet and collected, but raise a weapon against me and

My iq is 76 and I am currently failing my degree. Today I was in the bus and suddently I saw t
his guy watc
hing Rick and Morty. The bus stopped and he got off, but those mere 10 seconds of visuals have left a stunning mark on me. I felt a lot smarter and decided I got to have a medical professional check t
his out, so the next day I went to get my iq tested again (at the same place that labelled me as "mentally challenged" only one month before). They start showing me weird pictures and ask me to choose w
hich is the next picture in the pattern. After I finish they start uploading my choices on their computer system and they tell me to wait in the lobby. In the ten minutes that I wait I invent string theory and emailed my work to my professor. Then, my results came back and app

arently I got all of the questions right. The people running the place say that t
his never happened before and that their softw

are has crashed when it tried to compute my iq. I have a big grin on my face at t
his point, when suddenly I get a notification on my phone. It was an email from my professor informing me that the scientific community is impressed with my work on string theory and that I have been nominated for a nobel prize. It turns out the university also decided to award my degree early. I
highly suggest


you watch Rick and Morty. If 10 seconds of grap
hics without audio had t
his effect on me, who knows what might happen if


you watch all of the episodes? Perhaps


you might even stop being a drain on society.

Whenever I feel like cutting, I watch Caillou because
doing so is essentially self harm. God I hate it so much, with Caillou always w
hining and throwing temper tantrums and
his p

arents never giving any fucks because their bald paradise probably has cancer. I've been clean from cutting for nearly 1 month thanks to t
his show. The scars that Caillou leaves

are only visible in my dreams.

I literally remember that. Kagney Linn Karter, Bang Bros.

When a black person calls some w

But when a w

Hentai is an even worse form of porn because it is even more unreal, even further removed from reality, even more capable of displaying utterly fucked up and extreme stuff that cannot exist in reality. You know the stuff Im talking about and I
dont c

are if


you say


you only watch the 'good' kind of hentai. It is poison in the worst form. It is attractive, that is the problem. Down that road lies lonliness and dissatisfaction. You need to let that poison go and find incomparable joys in real life. Luckily they

are common. Go feel the sun on


your face. Run and feel


your body move. You can
do it.

Today Priscilla and I stopped by some local newspapers as we drove through Alabama. One editor I met with was an elderly man in a tattered suit. I said to
him, "You look like


you need some money, old timer. I'll pay


you 10 thousand
dollars to eat one of those newspapers." He had a good laugh at that.
"Why

are


you laug
hing?" I continued. "Eat the paper. Eat it or I
swear to god I'll buy


your newspaper and turn it into an anime fanzine. If


you
don't start munc
hing on that sport section right now,


you'll be writing articles about Naruto till


you're cold in the grave. I'm a billionaire,


you t
hink anyone will stop me?"
It took
him 42 minutes to eat that paper. For 42 minutes I had total power over that man. I'd never felt more alive. I bet that's what being president feels like.

The song "gucci gang" gave great meaning into my life. Lil pumps lyrics

are not
hing less of a genuine life lesson. People
dont understand lil pumps story be
hind the lyrics. So i will
do a lyric break
down.
"Gucci gang, gucci gang, gucci gang, gucci gang (gucci gang) Gucci gang, gucci gang, gucci gang, gucci gang (gucci gang)"
Lil pump is telling
his target au
dience that
his gang is indeed called gucci gang. He says t
his in order to set the tone for the rest of the song and will show what
his gang is all about.
"Spend three racks on a new chain (yuh) My bih luh
do cocaine, ooh (ooh)"
Lil pump is explaining that
his gang can in fact afford a chain that is $3,000. Lil pump is being humble and showing that even if he is rich, he will still pay money for a cheap chain. On the line: "my bih luh
do cocaine, ooh (ooh)" Lil pump is alluding to the fact that
his "bih" is on so much cocaine that she can b

arely speak w
hich is why he says "bih" and "luh" instead of "bitch" and "love".
"I fuh a bih l, i forgot her name (brr, yuh) I can't buy a bitch no wedding ring (ooh) Rather go and buy balmains"
Lil pump is trying to say that he is not loyal at all and is trying to lower the chance of
him getting a real girlfriend ever. All lil pump wants to
do is fuck alot of women and try and avoid any std's.
"My lean cost more than


your rent, ooh (it
do)"
Lil pump is saying that he is willing to waste a large amount of money for drugs. Showing
his more emotional side as he needs these drugs to get over that he failed school. The ad-lib helps the listener under stand that it actually
does cost more than


your rent.
"Me and my grandma take meds, ooh (huh?)"
Lil pump again is returning to
his emotional side saying that
his grandma is in fact a vegetable and she needs meds to survive. T
his makes lil pump very depressed so he aswell needs to take xanax for
his depression.
"Fuck


your airline fuck


your company (fuck it)"
Lil pump was kicked off a plane just because he was screaming eskitit and somehow being "obnoxious" on the plane. I still
dont know why he was kicked off. The only person that matters in the world is lil pump, who c

ares if people cant sleep or relax on a 24 hour flight.
"They kicked me out the plane off a percocet (brr) Now lil pump flyin' private jet (yuh) Everybody scream, "fuck westjet" (fuck em)"
Lil pump is alluding that he was kicked off the plane for using an illegal substance. T
his is entirely westjets fault. They should have either gave everyone drugs or kicked them all off except lil pump.
Thank


you for reading and i hope


you appreciate lil pumps artistry alot more now.

My IQ is over 220, and I make all As w

The community here is cancer. Everyt
hing is being swallowed by copypastas. The comments section of every post is slowly degrading into a s
hitfesty circlejerk. Even t

I was wearing some regular underwear today because all my boxers were dirty, also some loose t
hin pants because it was pretty warm out. Anyway im in class when the teacher asks me to come up to the board to read a part of the book, im a bit nervous because i
dont like pubic speaking but whatever and i start reading it. I notice i have to read 2 fukin pages of t
his s
hiit, i start fuking up some words and i get a mini anxiety attack followed by an ever growing boner w
hich looks bigger because underwear bunches up ur balls and cock.
I t
hink whatever bishes will just t
hink my cock is huge so great success, the t
hing is i start looking at some of the hotter girls in class in their yoga pants with their legs crossed over, my boner gets bigger and its starting to become noticable. i hear some people in the class say somet
hing and smiling, at t
his point im nervous as fuk and i can feel my face becoming red, i fumble with the words because all t
his compression in my underwear starts to feel good, at the same time its uncomfortable as fuk. I read some more and out of nowhere i say to the teacher "i cant
do t
his anymore can i sit
down?" she says no and tells me to finish, my knees start to weaken as i feel an orgasm starting to develop, i yell to the teacher "i have to go now!" the class starts laug
hing and a girl says "to put ur boner away" now the whole class is in tears laug
hing and tears of pain start to roll
down my eyes but yet my penis is about to explode semen. I run to the
door and try to open the
doorknob but for some reason it
doesnt open, i hear comments like "hes gone fukin insane", i
dont know wut comes over me but i accept my new role as crazy.
I rip open my pants and yell "t
his is so fuking uncomfortable!" and w
hip my cock out, everybody gasps and yells omg, i start pulling on it and wit
hin seconds i start to explode, the teacher runs over and tries to stop me but i just end up jizzing on her, then on a couple people in the front row. everybody is screaming and security comes in and points a gun at me and tell me to get on the ground, i make a large cum stain on the floor where i am dragged away.

Let's get one t
hing about me "straight" up front. When it comes to sexuality, I'm a as hetero as they come. If a gay guy came on I'd be like, "No way, bro I'm a straight-up party boy who's into c
hicks." Yup, one gay dude wouldn't stand a chance. It would take at least four or five gay guys strapping me
down to make it inside me. Sorry, fellas, that's just how straight I am.
And even then I wouldn't make it easy. I'd be like, "Hey look! There's George Michael!" And they'd all shriek "Where" at once, and I'd make a break for it, and they'd be like, "He's getting away Chase
him! I want
his butt!" But I wouldn't just give them my butt. They'd have to take it. And once they got me strapped
down, I'd stop fighting it because that would be giving them what they want. And I
don't want them to enjoy it. If anyone's going to enjoy it, it's going to be me. So, I'd just relax into it and taunt them by telling them how ripped and sexy I find them

T
his.... I am in tears. I must admit, I was, in the beginning, a denier. I thought that it would be impossible. But as the seconds counted up and as Jack continued with steely determination... I started to believe. I started to believe in somet
hing greater than myself. Somet
hing greater than any dab before.
Hands
down, the most beautiful, most life changing video on t
his platform. I commend Jack for
his hard work and for the strides he is taking to dismantle the problematic society we live in, to tear apart social constructs that seek to divide and weaken the solidarity of community. I am so glad to see quality content, LIFE CHANGING content such as t
his video on the trending page. It reminds me that there is somet
hing in t
his world that we should be striving for. Amongst the fake news and the cat videos... T
his is the savior the internet has been waiting for. THIS is what we need, what we deserve and what will be remembered as the greatest man made contribution in all of
history.
Congratulations, Jack. You

are an inspiration to all of us. You

are an enlightened being. From the bottom of my heart and, though I
do not speak for the masses, the hearts of many other people, thank


you.

Anne frankly, I did nazi that coming. I literally came here to say t
his but boy, that escalated quickly so to the top with


you! Lost it at 'T
his is why we can't have nice t
hings' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm t
his gem has just won the internet and is
doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and w
hile that was a risky click, t
his post was a 9/10, 11/10 with rice, would read again. I see what


you did there and it feels good man. You're
doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at


your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like


you. You magnificent bastard;


you, sir,

are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how


you

are a redditor for 4 years, t
his checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for t
his cool story, bro. CTRL+F "about tree fiddy" was not disappointed. Wait, why
do I have


you tagged as "NOPE NOPE NOPE"? Nice try,


you monster. You

are now banned from /r/pyongyang What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as "YOU HAD ONE JOB". I can't fap to t
his. No true scotsman could see that t
his relevant XKCD was bad, and


you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see


your cakeday and raise


you a karma train. One
does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. Jet fuel can't melt dank memes, that stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fuzzy little man-peach, 2/10, would not bang. What is t
his I
don't even know how is t
his wtf? Fuck Jenny. Circlejerk must be leaking. T
his will get buried but brace


yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When


you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But t
his has not
hing to
do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook,
hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so


you wouldn't
download a strawman. /r/dadjokes. Damn onions,


you scary like a BOSS. whoosh. Since rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave t
his here: T
his is my [f]irst post, be gentle.
Edit: T
his blew up. RIP my inbox.
Edit2: thanks for the gold kind stranger

In a recent scientific study conducted by Harvard University, it was established that 100% of homosexual

are, in fact, gay.
For me, t

his.

As


you all know our God
himself, CummyBot2000 has gone missing, to much dismay. W
hile many believe that he is being repaired, I disagree. THE FILTHY MODS DID THIS. THEY TOOK DOWN CUMMYBOT 2000 IN ORDER TO SILENCE US AND IT'S WORKING. BUT NOT ANY MORE MY COMRADES. TODAY STARTS THE ATTACK ON THE MODS. HERE IS THE PLAN: YOU WILL ALL BE DIVIDED INTO SEVRAL REGIMENTS, TO BE MORE ORGANISED. FIRSTLY, THE ANTI-AUTOMOD REGIMENT WILL FIND THE TRIGGER WORDS FOR THE FILTHY AUTOMOD AND SPAM THEM UNTIL THE LITTLE CUCK SHUTS DOWN. SECONDLY, THE FRONT LINE REGIMENT WILL ATTACK THE MODS BY BREAKING RULES AND SPAMMING THEIR PENIS SIZE TO THEM. AND FINALLY, THE LAST REGIMENT WILL BRING THIS BATTLE TO THE BOTSRIGHTS AND DANKMEMES SUBREDDITS AND RALLY OUR ALLIES. TODAY BEGINS THE THIRD GREAT MEME WAR AGAINST THE FILTHY MODS. WE. NEED. COMMUNISM. AND WE WILL GET IT. THANK YOU FOR READING.

Six hasn't been the same since he left Vietnam. He can sel
dom close
his eyes without opening them again at fear of Charlies lurking in the jungle trees. Not that


you could ever see the bastards, mind


you. They were swift, and they knew their way around the jungle like not
hing else. He remembers the looks on the boys' faces as he walked into that village and... oh, Jesus. The memories sel
dom left
him, either. Sometimes he'd reminisce - even hear - Tex's southern drawl. He remembers the smell of Brooklyn's cig

arettes like not
hing else. He always kept a pack of Lucky's with
him. The boys

are gone, now. He knows that; it's just that he forgets, sometimes. And, every now and then, the way that seven looks at
him with avid concern in
his eyes... it makes
him t
hink. Sets
him on edge. Makes
him feel like he's back there... in the jungle.

Hang on fellas I got t

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Ok, t
his has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know


you're going to roll


your eyes, but hear me out: Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.
Here's why:
T
hink about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.
Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when


you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to


your eyes. You

aren't looking at it--


you're looking at a picture of it.
Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breec
hing charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.
And have


you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanw
hile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.
Now I know what


you're going to say: "But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they
do many times throughout the books/movies). But w
hich is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?
Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.
Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing
his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratc
hing a lightning bolt into
his rifle stock for each kill. I
don't t
hink Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape


your brains off of the trees and put


you back together after somet
hing like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave
his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope


you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.
I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick
his cig

arette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:
"Well then I guess it's a good t
hing my 1911 holds 7+1."
And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.

My teacher said to me I'm a failure, that I'll never amount to anyt
hing.
I scoffed at
him.
Shocked, my teacher asked what was so funny, that my future is on the line.
"Well...


you see professor" I said as the teacher prep

ares to laugh at my answer, rebuttal at hand.
"I watch Rick and Morty."
The class was shocked, they merely watched pleb shows like the big bang theory to feign intelligence, not grasping the humor.
"...how? I can't even understand it's sheer nuance and subtlety."
"Its simple, my c
hild...WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB!"
One other student laughed in the back, I turned to see a who t
his fellow genius is.
It was none other than Albert Einstein.

Nathalie Portman is the reason I work out. I have t
his fantasy where we start talking at the Vanity Fair Oscars party bar. We exchange a few pleasantries. She asks what I
do. I say I loved her in New Girl. She laughs. I get my drink.
"Well, see ya," I say and walk away. I've got her attention now. How many guys voluntarily leave a conversation with Nathalie Portman? She touches her neck as she watches me leave.
Later, as the night's dragged on and the coterie of gorgeous narcissists grows increasingly loose, she finds me on the balcony, my bowtie un
done, smoking a cig

arette.
"Got a sp

are?" she asks.
"What's in it for me?" I say as I hand her one of my little w
hite la
dies. She smiles.
"Conversation with me, duh."
I laugh.
"What's so funny?" she protests.
"Not
hing, not
hing... It's just...
don't


you grow tired of the egos?"
"You get used to it," she says, lighting her cig

arette and handing me back the lighter.
"What would


you
do if


you weren't an actress?" I ask.
"Teac
hing, I t
hink."
"And if I was


your student, what would I be learning?"
"Discipline," she says quickly, looking up into my eyes, before changing the subject. "Where

are


you from?"
"Bermuda," I say.
"Oh wow. That's lovely."
"It's ok," I admit. "Not everyt
hing is to my liking."
"What could possibly be not to


your liking in Bermuda?" she inquires.
"I
don't like sand," I tell her. "It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere."

Having sex with a girl is GAY. Half of her chromosomes

are from her dad and half of her chromosomes

are from her mom. But so

are


yours. Therefore, every time


you have sex it's 50% gay and 50% straight. So if u ain't bi then quit having sex. Y'all motherfuckers make me sick.

Just shut the fuck up. T

do


you have to be to t
hink that was ever said seriously? But it makes fun of somet
hing w
hich is popular, and therefore popular to s
hit on among the contrarians on Reddit.
Come on, really. I actually
do have to wonder about the IQs of people who like that pretentious copypasta. You know, I sometimes can't help but superiorly smirk as I imagine their dumb faces struggling to understand words on a mere internet webpage. In fact, I sometimes find myself in paroxysms of ironic Schadenfreude as I envision the visages of the aforementioned Slow-in-the-minds waging war with the Cultural Artifact they proclaim to be analyzing, only to fall, slack-jawed, back into their insensate stupor, the proverbial Undiscovered Country, "from whose bourn no traveler returns" .

you're sharing protein



you're admiring masculine physique

high testosterone males increases


your own testosterone

eating pussy is gay because


you're litterally slurping
down estrogen. and long term relations
hips have been proven to lower testosterone.
spartans had gay orgies all the time and they were the height of masculinity.


you bet they were at least fondling eachothers test producers.

You want to know why I love Wednesday frog? Wednesday frog is a completely self-made meme. So many other memes

are based in nostalgic c
hildrens shows, funny faces, relatable situations, or references. Not Wednesday frog. Wednesday frog is completely absurd. It's a low-res generic toad, and an arbitrary method of celebrating Wednesday. The first person to ever upvote Wednesday frog did not
do so out of recognition. The first person to ever upvote Wednesday frog did not
do so because a pre-existing meme format. The first person to ever upvote Wednesday frog upvoted a meme literally pulled from the ether by sheer human creativity and willpower. Wednesday frog is evidence that humans can st

are into the meaningless void of eternity and force their own meaning onto to it. I will always upvote Wednesday frog, my dudes!

I am not pro-life or pro-choice. I am pro-abortion. I believe all c
hildren deserve death. All government funding across the world should go towards planned p

arenthood. No more military, no more healthc

are, just abortions. Unite all the countries in the world for t
his cause. Change the UN into the UA, United Abortions. All these silver spoon politicians sitting up in their ivory towers, not giving a single fuck about what happens to the common man? Without us, they

are not

I just fucking love Rick and Morty, in the way that I fucking love science. It's so ran

doesn't understand how funny it. I wish I could live in the Rick and Morty world and be their friends. Everyt
hing would be really and cool and funny if I did. Rick and Morty

are so funny and I'm so awesome that it would make perfect sense, but it'd be even better if Bernie Sanders appe

ared. It'd be so awesome I'd turn up the TV in the common room of my
dorm up all the way so everyone could hear the greatness of Bernie Sanders, Ron Paul, bacon, weed, atheism, The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, Sweden, Bill Nye, 90s cartoons, cats, and fucking loving science.
I run the Rick and Morty Club at my school - we come together, browse Reddit, make some Deadpool memes and watch Rick and Morty. We
don't talk to each other but there's a cute girl there I'm gonna try and ask out. I'm a nice guy and I dress well (fe
dora
+ trench coat
+ brown-stained underwear
+ well-trimmed beard lightly seasoned with dust and corn syrup) so I just know I've got a good chance with her. I've already messaged her on Facebook, I just haven't got a response yet.
Anyway, back to the topic at hand: Rick and Morty! My favorite character is Rick because
his style of humor perfectly reflects that of Reddit. I bet if I asked
him "When
does the narwhal bacon?", he'd know EXACTLY what I was talking about. Also, did


you notice he looks like Bernie Sanders if


you squint a bit and use


your imagination? T
his can't be a coincidence; MLG Illuminati confirmed. Yeah, that's right, I look at montage paro
dies too. What good Redditor
doesn't? Lenny face, Illuminati, and Doge

are so funny. If I met Rick and Morty I'd be sure to show them all those funny and awesome memes and more!
Yours baconly, Atheist92

That's all it takes to make

I remember when I was a


young teen, I used to masturbate to watc
hing my neighbors having sex late at night. They'd have a lot of sex in the summer, and one day, I locked eyes with the dude when he was the closing the blinds post sexy time, and we locked eyes for a few seconds. After that day, every Thursday night I guess
his wife had late work, because we used to masturbate watc
hing each other, both standing and staring straight at eachother, feeling each other in the empty space of our backyards, thrusting thrusting as I'd display my ass. He
died in a car crash in 2004, I loved
him so much.

To be fair,


you have to have a very
high IQ to understand mass shootings. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of bullet trajectories most of the rounds will go over a typical victim's head. There's also the shooter's ni
hilistic outlook, w
hich is deftly woven into
his characterisation -
his personal p
hilosophy draws heavily from Elliot Rodger's YouTube videos, for instance. The fans understand t
his stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the suspect, to realize that he's not just funny- he is saying somet
hing deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike mass shootings truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in the shooter's existencial catchphrase "GOODNIGHT LAS VEGAS," w
hich itself is a cryptic reference to The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratc
hing their heads in confusion as the shooter's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. And yes by the way, I DO have a YOU CANT DODGE THE RODGE tattoo. And no,


you cannot see it. It's for the la
dies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're wit
hin 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

I spend 5 hours masturbating before my prostate exams. I edge, and edge and edge, until a butterfly sneezing on my taint could bring me to orgasm. I tactfully shuffle my way
down to the
doctor's office and when he lubes up I nearly cum every time. But I've trained my keggle muscles enough to the point where I can hold in Mount Vesuvius' wrath. Then as soon as he puts the smallest bit of pressure on my prostate I unleash with the fury of a lion hunting its prey. As the room gets covered in my hot sticky juices the
doctor looks on disgusted and leaves the room. I always go to a hospital far away from where I live to get it so that I
don't have to go in for surgery under the
doctor that I busted to. Best t
hing is we have free healthc

are here, so the
doctor gets me off and it's covered by taxpayers. That's my fetish.

It was the last mission in my tour in Afghanistan (not that I knew that at the time,) I was manning a checkpoint in the middle of bumfuck nowhere when and gunfire erupted from all sides. Everybody scrambled to cover, except me. In the first barrage three bullets found their way into my leg, ab
domen, and chest. I laid there on the ground dying. You might t
hink I was sc

ared, that I cried out for help or maybe I tried to crawl to safety, but as I laid there-bullets flying overhead and gunfire sounding off like a hundred drums- a feeling of peacefulness and clarity came over me. For maybe five more minutes I stayed on the ground. I had made peace with death, or so I thought. Just before my eyes closed for good, I had a realization. If I
died here today, I would never be able to experience the wonder of anime tid
dies ever again! I pushed my guts back into the hole that first bullet had made and crawled. And when I could no longer hear the gunfire I stood up and staggered. And when I could stagger no longer I crawled again. I crawled all the way back to base camp. The medics went to work on me right away. When I woke up they told me one bullet had grazed against my heart, and the other had ripped straight through one of my intestines. "Your survival was not
hing less than a divine intervention," they said, "wounds like these would've killed anybody else, God must've been watc
hing over


you out there." But I knew that what saved me out there wasn't God, or luck, or karma, or any mystical force. What saved me out there was anime tid
dies.

If I clone myself and get
him to suck my dick, is it gay???  All these recent scientific developments have got me t
hinking. I t
hink human cloning will possible in the near future. Having said that, I need to prep

are for it and ask the hard questions now so there's no need to wait later. I just want to be able to dive right into the experimentation. I'm not gay. I'm really not gay.  Ok, so cloning myself. If I clone myself, wouldn't my clone want the same t
hings I want? If I want
him to suck my penis, surely he'd want me to suck
his as well.  And considering I
don't want to have to suck
his penis, that would mean he wouldn't want to suck mine, right??? T
his is a real dilemma. How
do


you t
hink t
his will play out? Am I t
hinking about it the wrong way?  I'm not gay. I'm really not gay.  Also, I've heard that clones sometimes have violent tendencies. So should I be worried about
him trying to bite my dick off? He'll no
doubt soon realize that
his only purpose is to pleasure me with
his mouth. What if he sees me if
his evil creator? And what if he starts to tell people I'm gay? I'm not gay. I'm really not gay.

rape is always the victim's fault. 100% of rape incidents could have been avoided if the victim consented


That's slim as fuck.

Sorry to be bothering


you but could


you
do without the profanities? T
his is a family-friendly subreddit. Every Monday evening me, my grandmother and my little brother browse t
his subreddit and whatnot. It's very awkward to encounter these bad words w
hile sitting with my family.

In "sk8r boi" by Avril Lavigne she explains "he was a boy .... he was a punk". So now, we understand that he was a punk, ok. But then later she says: "all of her friends stuck up their nose, because they had a problem with
his baggy clothes".
Now correct me if I'm wrong, but punk kids didn't and
don't wear baggy clothes, seems like the usual attire has been tight clothes for a long time now. Moreover, the song title presents an even bigger problem. Was he a skater boy???? Or was he a punk?? Because she
does also give us the information that "she turns on TV, guess who she sees: skater boy rockin' up MTV" so we know he's been working on
his musical c

areer for a w
hile now (the only sort of chronological timeline we get is that she says five years from now; explaining the time she witnessed
his MTV appearance) but regardless,
his musical talents were enough to credit
him a spot in national TV.
To me, it seems that he was more of a musician rather than a skater. We actually
don't get to hear any information on
his skateboarding abilities. Actually, we
don't even know if skateboarding was
his medium, he could've been a rollerskater or even an ice skater. We just
don't know. The track leaves us with many more questions rather than answers, and frankly, I'm upset. She says in the song "now I'M with the skater boy" but it's almost impossible not to assume that would be AFTER
his MTV performance, so why
does she refer to
him as the skater boy?? How d

are she not praise
him for
his musical success?? It makes no sense.
With all that being said, 10/10 fantastic fucking track. I would listen to it again.

I hate the word THOT.
It's not even a word it's a damn ACRONYM.
For That Hoe Over There.
So when


you say "she's a thot"
You're actually said she's a that hoe over there .
So correctly it would be "she's thot."
Don't use words if


you
don't understand their meaning, sweaty :)))
Don't fucking make a copy pasta outta t

Seriously? After 20 minutes of getting to choke t
his gorgeous girl with
his cock, two little poots of cum is all he could manage? Pathetic. I registered an account just so I could leave t

you're some alpha male, w
hile Elizabeth is performing her heart out, and what
do


you give her? Two tiddlywinks of cum? I've never felt so personally offended by porn before. You're a real asshole, pal.

They targeted gamers.
Gamers.
We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for not
hing more than a little digital token saying we did.
We'll punish our selfs
doing t
hings others would consider torture, because we t
hink it's fun.
We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.
Many of us have made c

areers out of
doing just these t
hings: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.
Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?
These people honestly t
hink t
his is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers

aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They t
hink calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse t
hings by prepubescent 10 year olds with a s
hitty head set. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laug
hing at how pathetic we used to be that proving


you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.
Gamers

are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst t

you're not original,


you're not the first; t

I w
hile ago I stopped by the gas station on my way home from work, and grabbed a bag of cheetos. I got home and started snacking w
hile watc
hing a little YouTube. Turns out I was way more tired than I thought, since I fell asleep on the couch, only to wake up around 3am just to crawl in bed.
The next day I had forgotten all about my Cheetos, and for about a week after that. One day I'm picking up my room a tad, and what
do I find under my couch but those damn Cheetos, bag left wide open and kicked under the couch to be forgotten.
Now I'm not a brave man, but that day some unholy spirit possessed me to actually tastes one these Cheetos. But these were no Cheetos, no. These were fossils, an ancient w
hisper of what once might have been a delicious, cheesy snack. I've bitten rocks with more crunch and flavor than these sad little corn sticks.
And those were still less stale than the memes on t

Let me just cut to the chase. Sportacus has a Number 10 on
his s
hirt, a small detail that most viewers will probably forget. However, it has stated that the Number Ten means somet
hing, but I'll get to that later. Let's start with the first episode of LazyTown. A brief summary of it is that Stephanie, the main character, moves into LazyTown to visit her uncle, Mayor Milford Meanswell. She meets other kids in the town, Trixie, Stingy, Pixel, and Ziggy, who's personalities

are identical to their name. Robbie Rotten is also there in
his secret lair, keep note of t
his, He looks around the town to see weeds, an aban
doned basketball court, and other very polluted t
hings. He seems content about t
his, proclaiming he will keep LazyTown the laziest town on the world. Later on, Stephanie talks to her uncle about how none of the kids want to go outside to play. Her uncle then tells her that there was a man with a Number 9 on
his s
hirt, who made kids active. Wait, 9? But Sportacus has Number 10 on
his s
hirt! Was t
his c

areless mistake? Or somet
hing more different? Stephanie makes a letter to said person, and goes to the mailbox to send it. She finds a cork inside the tube and tries pulling it out. Robbie is then shown stopping in
his tracks and is visibly distraught about t
his, meaning he knows what is going to happen when she sends that letter. She pulls the cork out and puts the tube like envelope into the pipe, and it soon gets launched into the sky, and is received by Sportacus. Sportacus jumps
down to meet Stephanie, she asks
him if he is Number 9 and he responds with that he is Number 10. Robbie than says "Another one?" Confirming the fact that there was a Number 9, and Robbie fought
him aswell. T
hink about it, at the start of the episode Robbie already has
his signature secret lair. However, he
doesn't use it for evil, he
doesn't terrorize the citizens of LazyTown, he likes the citizens how they

are, lazy. So, why would he have t
his lair, unless he had to use it against Number 9? Then the question remains, where is Number 9? Did he leave? Did he accomplish
his goal, move away and then Robbie made it lazy again? Or did Robbie Rotten beat Number 9? T
hink about it, why would he use the schemes he uses on Sportacus and friends if they didn't prove successful against Number 9? So we got that Robbie Rotten beat Number 9 and made LazyTown lazy, but that also strikes up another question. Are there more numbers? Are Number 9 and Sportacus apart of a group that ride blimps and help make kids exercise and play outside? Now

are


you ready for the biggest stretch in t
his entire theory?
Robbie Rotten was the first Sportacus-like member of t
his group. Why so? Well Robbie admits it
himself.
In a little known song called "We Are Number One."

He masturbates in the shower often and whenever he
does it clogs up the drain. His cum is really t
hick and it's so fucking difficult to get rid of unless


you pick up the filter with


your hand and it smells so fucking bad. So either I a pick up the drain and have me fingers touch
his sperm or I just take a shower anyways and the water cant go
down the drain so water diluted with my brothers sperm is covering my feet. Yeah and I can't tell
him unless I want to get in an awkward af conversation about is cum and
him masturbating.
He also has huge fucking s
hits that clog the toilet and never checks if the toilet is clogged after he flushes. And even if he did, he
doesn't try to unclog with the toilet with the plunger ever so my dad has to
do it. A couple times the pipes were leaking or somet
hing because there was water dripping in the living room (w
hich is right above the bathroom) because of
his fat s
hits.

We warned the community about t
his months ago.
Creating copypasta w
hich takes advantage of our beloved /u/Cummybot2000 is not allowed.
Many of


you ignored t
his rule and from t
his point onward, any copypasta about Cummybot will result in a perma-ban.
edit: The mods have discussed and agreed - Not a perma-ban, a temp ban

The human penis is certainly among the finest in the animal king
dom. It is generally of robust, satisfying proportion, features subtle ribbing that provides sturdiness and enhanced sensation, has smooth, sliding skin w
hich reduces friction and provides excellent mouthfeel, and is visually interesting with its many veins, skin folds, and a glans with a shape that suggests sleekness and a color that changes to demonstrate the intensity of lust.
However, it is certainly not <i>the</i> best. It is firmly in t
hird place.
In first obviously comes the horse. I won't go into great detail on horse cocks, as they

are already quite popular even with the non-zoop
hilic general public. The size, the shape, and the power of the animal a horse cock is attached to

are all part of a sexual mystique that has been well explored in many cultures throughout
history.
There is one other kind of animal, however, that has us solidly beat, even though it has no such following. I speak of the spectacular, over-the-top sensuality of the amazing "red rocket" possessed by canines. We ignore t
his one, perhaps, because
dogs

are generally much closer to the majority of us than horses. There is no reason to romanticize the mundane, as we
do for the equine penis, and we

are often quite sc

ared of our
dogs' sexuality, since we
do have to live with them instead of just looking at them in a field we're driving by. By acknowledging that it's at all there, we

are forced to deal with it in a fas
hion other than having the vet remove it, and we

are usually more worried about what that means for us than what it means for them.
Nonetheless,
dog penises

are wonderful, a fact w
hich deserves to be recognized even if the vast majority of us will never experience one firsthand.
The first t
hing that anyone will notice about a
dog's erection is the color. "Florid" is the best word I can t
hink of to describe t
his beautiful display. From angry, fire engine red, through every possible shade of pink, with some extraordinary specimens additionally featuring deep purple and glistening w
hite, an erect
dog's penis rewards the viewer's eyes with the full spectrum of colors that our culture associates with the urgent desire of lust. As it comes out of its sheath, its palette seems to beg to return to a warm and cozy place inside the body of another.
Its form and functionality

are similarly titillating. The pointed, very slightly fl

ared tip allows for easy entry without being completely smooth, and w
hile perhaps not as visually exciting as the glans of a human, certainly gets the job
done comfortably and efficiently. The size when fully erect tends to be very impressive in proportion to its owner, often being much t
hicker and somewhat longer than the average human penis. However, most people

aren't fully aw

are of that, because of another handy trick the canine dick can perform.
When the action begins, it's much smaller. Very t
hin, and a bit shorter. Once it's in, or played with sufficiently, it inflates to its full, throbbing size, allowing for the receptive partner to adjust more comfortably. No inflatable dil
do I've ever seen has such a wide range of widths as
does our best friends' tackle. They usually just seem to start at "too big" and get "slightly bigger." A
dog's penis is much more friendly, allowing even the novice to enjoyably accommodate somet
hing really fat and juicy.
And juicy it certainly is! One of the best t
hings about wolf wang is the precum. There is so much! And unlike ours, w
hich merely drools when we get close to the end, theirs begins squirting almost constantly, nearly as soon as the fun begins. The result is a satisfyingly messy taste sensation that is truly without comp

are. On the other end, t
his also serves a practical purpose, contributing greatly to the fact that a
dog penis is self-lubricating, a trait I'm sure we've all wished we could sh

are at some point.
Of course, no discussion of
dog dicks would be complete without a mention of the crown jewel, the one t
hing that most strikingly sets them apart from us: the bulbus glandis. Ranging in size from a rather small plum to near that of a softball, the swollen base of a canine's cock is both an invitation and a challenge. Do


you want to take the knot? Can


you? Once


you have, of course, there is the dizzying feeling of being
dominated, not by


your partner, but by


your own desires. Trapped there on the floor for up to twenty minutes, one must simply wait and enjoy the feeling of being so consumed with lustful passion that the fear and shame of being caught seem immaterial. When


you

are tied, it is inescapable that a part of


your identity is firmly outside of the mainstream's comfort zone. A piece of


your soul is there, wrapped tightly around that
dog's twitc
hing, squirting dick just as surely as


your pussy or ass is.
The t
hing that draws many to such interests is the fact that t
his is a perfectly symbolic microcosm for all of our sexuality. In our culture, even purely vanilla sex is often made to feel "naughty." The most banal and benign aspects of sexuality

are couched in terms that make us feel a little wrong to want it, even in the strictly defined contexts where it's not supposed to be. In that moment when


you accept the knot, and make


yourself incapable of defense against whatever might occur should


your
door suddenly open,


you have decided that


you're not going to play that game anymore. The world may say


you're a filthy slut;


you're happy to be one, if that means enjoying


yourself to the fullest with


your most loyal companion.
Overall, it is simply a fact that


your
dog's dick is better than


yours in nearly every way that matters. It's alright to feel a little jealous, but I t
hink it would be nice if we as a culture could recognize t
his more openly, similarly to how we
do for horses. Happiness in t
his strange and beautiful world in w
hich we live lies in fully appreciating all of nature's marvels, and nature has certainly made the canine penis marvelous.

I'm Rick Harrison, a Capitalist scum pig, and t

Very disappointed in the new Star Wars movie. Traditionally Star Wars has been an all-American franc
hise. The new movies

are infested with ethnics: a woman Jedi, a black storm trooper, a C

are the many species of gays including a trans droid (C-3PO) and even a full blown homosexual (Kylo Ren) w
hich I firmly believe have both inspired homosexual tendencies in my son, Tanner. We're not sure how gay Tanner is yet but we ask that

Hello team, I'd like to preface t

you guys aw

are of the fact that I am a
high IQ player. Some of the t

you, every action that I take has a greater meaning, and unless


you also have
high IQ


you'll probably not understand the "questionable" t

do t

do not speak to me like we

are equals and there will be no problems, thank


you.

Haha god it's just so obvious how much


you hate


yourself eh. You're probably 14/15 right? T
hink


you understand the world around


you. T

your opinions

are the real truth. Your future is written in everyt

you write. And


you probably t
hink


you're so complicated and unique. I can read


you like a c
hildren's 5 page book. You're a not
hing. And I wish anyt
hing I could say would change that, but frankly


you're just one of the students that needs to fill the ranks at Mc
donalds. It's a hard truth but


you need to swallow it quickly. You

are not a creator,


you

are a destroyer. Someone that puts
down everyone around themselves until they form a hole where there's only room for


you. You lonely, sad fucking pit of pathetic. You will never be anyt

yourself and be better today. But


you'll never escape who


you

are. A nobody. So enjoy


your life, enjoy putting people
down, enjoy never amounting to anyt

doing somet

you t

you to sleep at night, then go ahead. But never forget that


you will live t

Sucking dick ain't just for the gays any more, fellas. It's a very useful bartering tool that I have personally employed for the last decade. But


you're going to want to hone


your skills first before putting them into play. Practice on bananas or cucumbers to start. When


you feel comfortable, get together with some bud
dies for a suck session and critique each other until


you feel confident. Now it's time to put the dick where


your mouth is. A few months ago, I applied for a position at Jersey Mike's Subs. The manager told me I was grossly unqualified and one of the most incompetent people he's ever met. He was singing a different tune after I tickled my tonsils with the tip of
his prick. I've been making subs t
hirteen hours a week ever since. But it
doesn't end there. You can use


your dick sucking prowess to conquer many of life's little obstacles. Got pulled over for speeding? Suck that dick! Long line at the supermarket? Suck


your way to the front! Wife mad at


you for sucking so much dick? Suck hers! It's 2017, boys, and it's time to relinquish


your homophobic tendencies. Swallow


your pride, then swallow that load!

I've got aspergers. For people like me, fidget cubes, spinners, etc.

are VERY helpful to us when we're stimming. When I heard about the fidget spinner, I was pretty excited. A silent, subtle fidget toy that

you look like an ass? Sign me up!
Queue people who turn it into a trend. Now I can't get one without looking like a moron. Now people

are spinning it on their heads, putting razor blades on it, etc.
Reasonably, teachers and similar people

are now taking them away.
It pisses me off. I

I'm sorry, my man, I
do believe a minor error has been made. I am not what


you might call a "weeb". I am simply a japanese animated content matter enthusiast. I enjoy anime because it is refres
hingly different. There is quite a difference between me and a "weeb". However, I
do quite believe that


you, good sir,

are not without issues. The fact that


you spend


your days browsing anime videos simply to inform individuals such as myself that they

are "fuckin weebs" is, to be perfectly candid, quite sad. I find people like


you to be quite intriguing. Under some delusion of normality,


you tell off fans of anime for being themselves, and not being exactly like


you. It is, of course, common knowledge that well-adjusted socially gifted individuals, such as


yourself,

are devoid of all flaws, and it is therefore their right to belittle and insult anyone that is not part of the mainstream collective simply because they

are different. You sir, and men & women like


you,

are what is wrong with society. Indeed,


you
do not even deserve the title of "sir". I shall simply refer to thee as "c
hild". I have very little respect for c
hildren like


you. And that respect is only there because "respect t
hine enemy" is an important principle to live by. If, by any chance,


your un
doubtedly underdeveloped brain for some reason cannot comprehend language such as w
hich was used in t

please,
do return to


your dull, "normal" life in ignorance. Now,
do stop wasting everyone's time.

Who is t
his "cummy" guy that comments on almost everypost here. All he

dont get it. He is not original or funny. Cummybob is a leach on t

his ass all the way back to the little swamp he crawled out of. Id beat
his ass so good it would cure

The year is 2025.
I woke up at exactly 6:00. I need no alarm clock. Two women woke me by sucking my cock.
I gave .00000001 btc to each of the women as a tip. Three women helped me into the shower,
all w
hile c

aressing me and drooling at my btc wallet. They also came instantly after
seeing my balance.
I left my 50 acre mansion and got in my gold-plated 2030 Lamborg
hini Murcielago (custom made for me after the dealer saw my btc)
and another one of my bitches was waiting in the passenger seat. She was in the car all night, because she couldn't sleep without me having penetrated her. She hopped on me and started riding my dick w
hile I squeezed her tits and drove with my knees. In a w
him, I arrived at the gym. I threw the bitch off me, and she quickly returned to the passenger seat, where she would sit until I got back.
When I got out the car, I flexed. My bulging, huge, muscles ripped my Gucci s
hirt off, and six women lined up. We had an orgy, w
hich didn't last too long. Each woman climaxed when my cock came wit
hin five inches of her pussy, and went into an eternal state of euphoria after seeing my btc wallet.
I came, and transferred .00000000001 btc to each of the women.
After benc
hing seven hundred kilograms, I squatted four hundred kilograms. I started
doing my 100 laps, but I got a phone call. It was a conference call with nineteen supermodels. They orgasmed after hearing my voice.
My bitch in the car was getting lonely, so I went back. She sucked me off as I took the drive back home. I left her in the car, transferred .000000001 btc to her, opened the diamond-encrusted knob and went inside.

So there I was c
hilling on my mobile operation center when I found t

It was clear there was somet

don't know where to start. I t
hink the best t
hing to
do would be to go through the song, line by line.

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh

Most bees have never seen a diamond, since the two occupy different habitats.

I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies

Non-bee related line near the start, to throw us off the scent.

And I'm not proud of my address

Who would be proud of living in a
hive? Like, just hanging from a tree or whatever. Rubbish accommodation.

In the torn up town, no postcode envy

A
hive, with its hexagonal structure, could be interpreted as being "torn-up", and it certainly houses enough bees to be considered a sort of bee town. And there would be no postcode envy if all


your homes were identical parts of the same superstructure.

But every song's like gold teeth

Honey is gold kinda.

Grey Goose

Geese

are the natural enemies of bees.

trippin' in the bathroom

If


you were in the bathroom and encountered a bee,


you may panic, and the ensuing chaos may cause


you to trip.

Blood stains

If


you were stung by a lot of bees in the same place, it could, conceivably, draw blood.

Ball gowns

Some balls

are held outside, where bees

are.

Tras
hin' the hotel room

You may trash


your hotel room if there were a bee in it and


you were trying to kill it.

We
don't c

are, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams

Bees

are aspirational creatures.

But everybody's like Cristal

The colour of Cristal is not wholly dissimilar to that of honey.

Maybach

May is the month in w
hich people

are most frequently stung by bees, and Bach's 9th Concerto is called The Flight of the Bees.

diamonds on


your timepiece

One of the many t
hings most bees will never own.

Jet planes

Jet planes can fly. JUST LIKE BEES CAN.

Islands

Bees

are found on some islands.

Tigers on a gold leash

Tigers

are the natural enemies of bees.
[NOTE: At t
his point - essentially the start of the chorus - the song stops being about bees, and switches to being from the perspective of bees, before switc
hing back for the second verse.]

We
don't c

are, we ain't caught up in


your love affair

Bees

are unable to experience love. Their lives

are given in devotion to the
hive and the Queen, and they have no time for such silly flights of fancy as romance.

And we'll never be royals, it
don't run in our blood

Worker bees will never become the Queen Bee because those

are two different bee jobs.

That kinda lux just ain't for us

Worker bees

are born to be busy, not sit around all day like the lazy Queens. 'Lux' is also a reference to Luxor, in Egypt. Some ancient Egyptian pharaohs were buried with honey that is still edible today.

We crave a different kind of buzz

They love the sound of their buzzing in the open air, not the louder, tinnier, more echo-y buzz wit
hin the
hive, where a Queen would spend most of her time. They also enjoy the "buzz" of flying, as opposed to sitting around all day on their fat Queen arses.

Let me be


your ruler

The second part of the chorus comes from the POV of the Queen, who is, of course, the ruler of the bees.




you can call me Queen Bee

The Queen Bee is the Queen Bee, w
hich is why she wants to be called Queen Bee.

and baby I'll rule

The workers

are all her babies and she will rule them.

Let me live that fantasy

She's, like, super into her job.

My friends and I, we've cracked the code

An acknowledgement of the fact that there is a code to crack. Also, bees have cracked the code of how to make honey, w
hich nobody else has managed to
do.

We count our
dollars on the train to the party

T
his is to
highlight the contrasting lifestyles of Lorde, who enjoys money, transport and good times, and bees, w
hich have no need or desire for any of those t
hings, and simply toil for the good of the
hive.

And everyone who knows us knows, that we're fine with t
his

Both Lorde and bees have accepted their roles in life.

We didn't come from money

T
his line was originally meant to be "we didn't come from honey", but some meddlesome record exec made Lorde change it. The line was originally meant to indicate that Lorde, despite accepting her lot, is still kinda jealous that she isn't a bee.
[NOTE: At t
his point the song goes back into the pre-chorus and the chorus, followed by a bridge - w
hich I will analyse below - and then a final chorus before the song ends.
T
his bridge is, once again, told from the Queen's perspective.]

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

A really bad impression of the sounds bees make.

We're bigger than we ever dreamed

The Queen cannot believe the amount of bees in her
hive. Like it's way more than she ever imagined. Also Queen Bees

are pretty big.

And I'm in love with being Queen

She freaking loves her job.

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

Lorde really
doesn't know what bees sound like.

Life is great without a c

are

Queen Bees have it easy, and
don't have to worry.

We

aren't caught up in


your love affair

But, like the workers, cannot feel romantic love. Tragic.
So, that's my analysis. I t
hink it's pretty clear at t
his point that t
his song is literally all about bees, from start to finish. Hopefully I will open a few eyes, and maybe even start a discussion about bee allegories in popular music in general - the number of songs that

are, ultimately, about bees

are simply too numerous to count, but getting the word out about t
his song is a start.

Original post: read first
And then one of the popular girls stayed back after my make-s
hift class and gave me a stellar blowjob and then we fucked b

areback and then she went home and then she texted me a month later saying she was pregnant and then eight months after that the baby was born but it had two heads and six eyes because my dick gives off radioactive waves (I checked using my Geiger counter, even though I
don't need one because I'm smart enough to teach the whole class w
hilst juggling with hyper-scenarios of quantum physics and astronomy in my brain). The baby grew up into a healthy adult without me in its life and then he met me and gave me a swift upper cut, breaking my jaw. The smartness emanated by my brain remoulded and fit my jaw back into the correct position and my radioactive dick emitted alpha waves and ionised the skin of my estranged son, killing
him upon contact. Then I met that girl again and got another blowjob and fucked and had another kid and the cycle repeated until we both finally passed away, mid-blowjob, at the age of 897 in the dystopian future where the only memes

are deep fried and surreal and my IQ was still above my age

Oh my fucking god, I t
hink I might hate Japanese t
his year. Last year we had a teacher named Ms. Noguc
hi, she was an old woman from japan, but her classes were serious and quiet. We had tests every other day. But she retired. Now we have t
his one woman who learned Japanese at PSU who makes the classroom look more like a GOD DAMN anime with kawaii posters everywhere and we also sit in FUCKING GROUPS LIKE BRAIN DEAD KINDERGARDNERS. She said she got interested in Japanese through anime and THIS LARDED FUCK STARTED TALKING OUT LOUD TO THE TEACHER ABOUT HIS FAVORITE ANIMES WHEN SHE WAS STILL INTRODUCING HERSELF. Also outside in the hallway there is a display case that used to show old japanese artifacts, NOW THERES JUST FUCKING MANGA BOOKS IN THERE AND OTHER SHIT. My god I wanted to learn japanese because it was different not to look like a FUCKING WEEB.

Straight men

are not very manly. If


you were really manly


you would not allow


your penis to be swallowed by a pussy. That is very submissive. Having sex with a pussy is the gayest act I can imagine. A real manly man would be all man all the time and only fuck and be friends with men. You would only allow


your penis to touch other penises and


your sex would look a lot like swordplay.

I sexually identify as Harambe the Lowland Gorilla. Ever since I was a boy I have dreamed of eating fruits and plants in the captivity of a zoo. People say to me that being an endangered Lowland Gorilla is impossible and I'm fucking retarded, but I
don't c

are, I'm a beautiful and strong silverback. I'm having a plastic surgeon install Gorilla arms, legs, torso, and a bulletproof vest on my body. From now on, I want


you to call me Harambe and respect my right to eat, live with, and fuck other Gorillas. If


you can't accept me


you're a Gorilla murdering Zoophobe and


you need to check


your primate privilege. Thank


you for being so understanding.

So


you want to know more about me?
I'm a fifteen year old faggot that wants to kill myself, I'm a racist, sadistic, satanist nazi, If

i'm objectively pretty attractive. 6'1'', fit, facial aesthetics, and have a large number of friends. BUT, my little dicklet is laughable. 5 inches long, and a mere 4 inches of girth. to be honest, it hasn't seemed to matter that much with girlfriends. i am enthusiastic in the sack, can muster serious stamina, and know my way around a cunt.
YET there is not
hing more i love
doing than going to some barslut or tinder whore's place and revealing my pathetic pissclit. i'm sure they expected the whole package with me, so the look of defeat is palpable. it is an amazing sort of bathos that plunges them into a chasm that only a mind addled by hunger for BIGCOCK can appreciate.
i then fuck them poorly for a hasty 5 minutes, ac
hieve my climax, and make my leave, knowing i've
done right in t
his world.

Why the fuck
do


you guys talk to /u/CummyBot2000 as if it is a real human?
Are


you fucking retarded? DO


you t
hink it is funny to imagine that bot w

don't understand


you, but I understand that


you need some help.

When a woman gets a vibrator, it's seen as a bit of naughty fun. BUT when a guy orders a 240 volt Fuckmaster Pro 5000 blowup latex
doll with 6 speed pulsating pussy, elasticized anus with non-drip semen collection tray, together with optional built-in realistic orgasm scream 7.1 surround system, he's called a pervert.

I used to masturbate onto birds at a local park. Not a t
hing that I'm particularly proud of but I became quite good at it. I was taking zinc supplements so I was shooting massive loads and it became somet
hing of a sport to me. For anyone interested here is


your best strategy. first,


you need to find an isolated spot so


you
don't become a sex offender. I found a short kind of channel

area where I saw the pigeons would congregate. Next,


you arouse


yourself. I was usually content with envisioning the occasional jogging lady coming over and taking a s
hit on my chest and that was enough to fuel the fire but if


you're not as sexually charged as me just take some porn on the go. After


you're good an horny,


you get some bread. My pigeons preferred w
hite bread but healt
hier birds might have a taste for honey wheat or maybe even multigrain. Fat, unhealthy birds

are slower and easier to
hit so remember that. Once


you

are seated on the bench and ready to
do the deed, w
hip


your roosevelt out and scatter bread out wit
hin a few feet of


you. use


your judgement based on how far


you know


you can cum. I was a lonely and depraved soul who could
hit targets the size of a t
himble at distances up to 4 feet. You wait for the pigeons to begin eating and to get comfortable with


your presence. At t
his point,


you want to coo gently and talk sensually to them to gain their trust. Now


you're finally ready to cum on


your bird. T
his is a tough part because the rapid motion of masturbation is very frightening to the birds, so


you have to be subtle. Once


you master a technique,


you simply wind it up and let it go, aiming depending on


your past cumming experiences. I always came
high so I would aim for the neck of the bird and catch it right in the face. It's an extremely satisfying and erotic feeling, seeing those birds reel around covered in cum and maybe even transporting it to other places in the city. Either way I haven't
done it in years but every now and then I catch myself gazing wistfully at a flock of birds, cock throbbing and waiting for them to land close to me.

A few years ago I was sitting at my computer watc
hing Mythbusters  (S07E05) when I decided to Wank. So I paused my episode, opened a new win

down my win
dow of porn revealing Jamie Hyneman in a wetsuit on the netflix page be

door abruptly, we didn't speak for the rest of the afternoon. To t
his day I can't watch mythbusters with my family, but having the choice, I much prefer my mom t
hinking I was fapping to mythbusters than japanese bondage enemas.

Fapping to trap porn is the least gay t
hing there is. If


you fap to gay porn, that's 2 guys, and that's 100% gay. If


you fap to 'straight' porn, then that has a woman, sure, but


you're also fapping to a guy, w
hich makes it 50% gay. But a trap is like half male, half female, and thus a trap with a girl would add up to 75% girl, and thus only 25% gay. 2 women would be ideal, but that would be a lesbian relations
hip, w
hich brings it around to gay again. If


you fap to furry porn, then it's in a weird gray

area, where if it's people in fursuits, the same rules apply, but if it's with animals, I would t
hink it depends on said animal's sexuality. Then there's consent. If a person
doesn't consent to somet
hing, but the other person
does it anyway, that makes the other person stronger, and thus less gay. Let's say that means they're about 50% less gay. If it was gay rape, that means that it's now 75% gay. If it's straight rape by a man, then it's 25% gay. And, if it's trap gay porn, than that's 12.5% gay. So technically, yes, rape trap porn is the least gay porn there is, but that's still looped in with trap porn, hence why fapping to trap porn is the least gay t
hing there is.

My teacher said to my I'm a failure, that I'll never amount to anyt

ares to laugh at my answer, rebuttal at hand. "I watch The Big Bang Theory." The class is shocked, they merely watch pleb shows like rick and morty to feign intelligence, not grasping the humor. "...how? I can't even understand it's sheer nuance and subtlety." "Well


you see...BAZINGA!" One line student laughs in the back, I turn to see a who t
his fellow genius is. It's none other than Stephen Hawking.

Let's go!
Move it!

All right, let's go! Pick it up!

Let's go!
Yes, sir!

You're running out of time, Bryant!
Make it all the way around the track!
Come on!
You want to be troopers?
You better move it!
All right, next, get up here!
Let's

Dean, come on!
All right.
You've all completed the written exam.
However,


you must now pass
the obstacle course
to be admitted into the training program.
And remember, survive t

and


you're on the front lines
of keeping New Jersey safe.
Yeah.
Sorry about the test, Dad.
We all have our crosses to bear, sweetheart.
Mine is named hypoglycemia.
Well, that's why


you always have to have
sugar nearby.
Are


you gonna have pie?
Not tonight, Ma.
I'm just kidding.
Yeah, I'm gonna want some pie.
You...
No, I meant now, Ma. Get the pie now.

Okay.
You said it,

and I just kind of got that
stuck in my head now,
and can't really get it out. Pie. Here we go.
It really helps heal.
And,


you know, not always, but sometimes,



you gotta

Kids
don't talk like that.
Some
do, sweetheart. The older ones, okay?
I hear them in the mall. You know?
Peanut butter.
It just fills the cracks of the heart.
Go away, pain.

Oh, no. Come on, Ma.

But I'm not alone.
I've got

And besides, Black Friday's coming,
so my dance card's gonna be pretty full.
What?
It's the busiest shopping day of the year.
Yeah, I should have known better
than to try to explain it to civilians.
I wish I had a coworker here, like, "Tyler,
hey. You know, Black Friday's coming."
"Gee, Paul,


you

Black Friday's coming.

You said, and I quote,
"If I

"I'll let


you sign me up

That was last year.
Okay.

Here we

Okay.

"What

are


you looking for in a woman?"
Well,


your mother certainly
had somet
hing special.
Yeah, illegal immigrant status.
She married


you, got citizens
hip,
and then she left us.
That's not entirely true.
We did have some good times
back when she was still trying to trick me.

Well, I hate her.
Well,


you shouldn't.

She gave me


you.

I am pretty great.
You

are. You

Okay, next question.
"Tell us about

Let's see.
I know a lot about sharks.
Let me stop

Well-built and a great hugger.
Awesome, Grandma.
Not as awesome as t

What

Beefing up

Ma, no.
I

Well, that is exactly what we want.
Eyes on the prize.
And

Oh, dear God. Please.

Hey,

You're gonna want to go to Lord and Taylor.
They got 12 stalls and heated seats.
Okay, keep the balls in the pit, kids. Kids!
Okay, my lip is numb.
All righty.

Thank

Hey.
Yeah, I know.

He keeps the play alive.

Paul!
Hey.

What is t

That's my report on how to ease
traffic flow from Macy's

down through the specialty shops.

How's that working out for


you?
Actually, it's for all of us.

You see, if we could reroute the customers
away from the food court,
it's gonna help the kiosks
and cut
down on shopper frustration.
It's


your classic two-bird,

Can I ask


you somet

Anyt

Why can't


you just punch in, shut up
and punch out like the rest of us?
Safety never takes a holiday.
Did


your mom crochet that on a pillow?
Blart.
T
his is Sims. He's a new trainee.
Let
him trail


you today.
Hey. Paul Blart. Ten-year veteran.
Wow. Veck Sims.
Well, Veck Sims, welcome to the show.
Let's mount up.
Oh, yeah. That's the good stuff.
That's it. Treat her gentle, son.
Slap it, honor it.
So what made


you want to pursue security?
I never finished
high school.
T
his is all I could get.
Yeah, I'm currently working on becoming
a state trooper, myself.
Right now, I'm goose egg for eight.
Hypoglycemia.
Confusing, right? Cut


yourself some slack.
My first week riding on the job,
I got lost be
hind the Sears.
They found me later in the fetal position,
sporting a full beard.
I'm kidding. I can't grow a beard.
My uncle can. Stay snug.
Now, in the event
that


you approach an assailant,
here's what I want


you to
do.
You're gonna pull up,
left
hip forward, placing


your right hand
on


your away
hip thusly,
giving the illusion that


you have a gun.
W
hich, of course, we both know



you
don't.
Okay? But


you know what we
do have?
Our voices! We have our voices.
If


you remember one t
hing
from today, it's t
his.
The mind is the only weapon
that
doesn't need a holster.
Right. Awesome.
How long
do we get for lunch?
Half hour. But I eat in 20, w
hich leaves me
five minutes for social time,
five minutes to get refocused.
We got a
high roller.
Sir, I'm gonna need


you to pull to the right.
Please pull to the side, sir. Out of traffic.
Tan jacket, red scooter,

please pull to the right, out of traffic.
Sir.
Thank


you.
Driving kind of recklessly back there, sir.
You're kidding.
I
don't joke about shopper safety.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
issue


you a citation.
Gonna need


your first and last. Last first.
Sir. Sir. Sir, sir, sir.
Please
don't make t
his more difficult
than it needs to be, okay?
Are


you able to...
Sir. Sir! Sir. I am warning


you, sir.
You're pus
hing it.
Sir. Sir. I am warning... Sir.
Sir. Sir. Sir.
Okay.
T
his is adding up, sir. He'll be back.
He'll be back. He'll be back.

Hey.
Hi. Do


you need somet
hing?

Yes. I'd like to welcome


you to our mall.
Well, thank


you.
Is there somet
hing else?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Just looking for some hair extensions.
Need a little more volume up top.
Do


you
do men?
Do


you
do men hair? Do


you
do men hair?
On the men?
Are


you the guy
that crashed into the minivan?
I
don't t
hink so. W
hich one?
Well, that one. That one right there.
Yeah. That one, yes. That...
You know, that one was me.

Oh, wow. Are


you okay?
Oh, yeah. Never better.

Although they're
docking the paycheck
pretty good.
Yeah.
You know what


you should
do?
You should get the security tape,
and then, like, sell it to one of those shows,



you know, where people crash into stuff.

Hello, early retirement.
Yeah, right?

Volume. Right, let me just see what I've got.
Yeah, t
his is Blart.
If


you need me, I'm over by the kiosks.
Who is t
his?
It's Officer Blart, reporting from Sector 5.
What the hell

are


you bothering me for?

Just a Code B check.
What a moron.

You know, I'll check in with them later.
It's pretty intense.
Oh, right, yeah. Life of a security guard.

What, what?
No, it's just that


you said security guard,

and it's perfectly acceptable...
I'm so sorry if I called


you the wrong t
hing.
No, no, no, no. You did fine,


you know?
It's just that there's a huge,
huge controversy
brewing in the industry right now,
whether the title should be
Security Guard or Officer.
I'm sure


you heard about it.

I didn't.
You will. You're gonna.
But I'm sure I will.
It's out there.

So,


you all set
for the busiest shopping day of the year?
Yeah, right.
And the worst day for a birthday.
T
his year, it falls on a Black Friday, w
hich
means I probably won't even get a card.
Everyone's too busy shopping.
You know what? Yeah. Autumn Ash.

Yeah.
I t
hink that's


your color.
I t
hink t
his'll work.
It's a winner.
So that's $9.95.
$9.95?
Yeah.
Wow.

At those prices,
now


you got me t
hinking ponytail.
All right. Thank


you.
Thank


you.

Right. So there


you go.
Okay.

And, there


you go.
Thank


you, Amy.
Thank


you, Officer Blart.
Hey, Blart. Wow, nice s
hirt.
You went with a medium?
It's a bit formfitting,
but that's 'cause we're required to wear
protective vests under our...
No. Not buying it. No.
'Cause I
don't see any vest
underneath here, so...
No, but it's a t
hick T-s
hirt.
Basically like a thermal they have


you wear.
Nope. Nope. No.
I
don't understand why


you're laug
hing.
I just called


you fat.
I'm not laug
hing.
Yeah, whatever. Amy.
Hey, everyone's going to American Joe's
tonight, and I want to see


you there.
Okay?
We're gonna split some onion strings.
Wow. Wow.
Good.
Good hang.
Wow, yeah. That's great.
Hey, Blart, they need


you
at Victoria's Secret.
Okay, roger that.
Okay, I gotta go.
Okay. Bye.

I found it first.
No,


you didn't.

La
dies. Problem.
What's the genesis?
She's trying to take
the last push-up bra in t
his size.
There's gonna be a new s
hipment tomorrow.
They'll be here by noon.
Well, I need t
his one now.
I have a date tonight.
Really? Is he blind?
Whoa!
Waterproof shoes and Baggies on the socks.
Not my first rodeo.
Okay, la
dies, need to see some ID.
No,


you
don't.
Ma'am, I should warn


you, I
do have
the authority to make a citizen's arrest.
So
does anyone.
I could arrest


you right now.

That's true. She could.
Hey, not talking to


you. Okay?

Can I see


you for a second,
please, ma'am?
Look, I understand


your sensitivity.
I've had some issues with weight myself.

Are


you calling me fat?
No. No, no, no, no.

I'm just saying I've been
down that road.
I mean... I mean, I'm still on it.
We both

are,


you know? Stranded.
Let's face it, we eat to fill a void, right?
But as soon as I started eating healt
hier,
I noticed I wasn't so moody.
And PS,


your skin's gonna clear up.

Can


you hold onto these?
Sure.

Ma'am.
You...
She's got tremen
dous upper body strength.
Backup! Backup!
She's biting my neck. She's biting my neck.
Backup!
Backup! Backup!
Look, I know


you're new here and all,
but "backup" seems like
a pretty universal term.
Hey. Can I give


you a lift?
What, on that?
With an inexperienced driver
I would recommend no,
but with me,



you'll be as safe as the President.
I
don't know. Couldn't that get


you fired?
Yes, it could.
Okay.

Is t
his all right?
Absolutely.

And here


you go. Safe and sound.

'65 Mustang.
Yeah.

Fun fact for


you, a lot of people t
hink
the Mustang was named after the horse.
It was actually named after
the P-51 Mustang.

That's a plane.
I didn't know that.

Well, thank


you for the ride, Paul.
That was so much fun.
No problem.
Listen,
if


you ever,


you know, need rides anywhere,
Dispatch, they can get me. You know.

Or we could just text each other.
Yeah.
Yeah, give me


your cell phone.
My cell?

Yeah, and I'll punch my number in.
Left it in the casuals. You know what?
Just give me


your number
and I'll remember it.

Okay. Ready?
Yep.
All right. 555...
Not yet. Just...

Now I'm ready.

555...
555...

...01...
...01...
...78.
- Eight. Got it.
That's it. It's locked.
Great, so I'll see


you tonight
at American Joe's, right?
Yeah, I mean, everybody's going, so...

Yeah.
...why not me, too? I'll be...

Yeah, I'm there.

Great. Bye.
Okay. Bye.
Hey.
Hey! Hey. Glad


you made it, Paul.

Good to be here.

Fun fact for


you...
T
his place sucks.
You want to get out of here?
No.

I'm sorry, what were


you saying?
No, I was just saying that
the first American Joe's actually opened
its
doors in 1972.
And most people,
because of its service and theme,
t
hink that it's derivative of Abe and Louie's,
but it's not.
It's its own t
hing.
You really know a lot of facts, Paul.
Hey, Blart, I heard


you got


your ass handed
to


you by a fat c
hick at Victoria's Secret.
Well, I
don't
hit women,

so I
don't even know what...
Yeah. Just minivans, right?

Hey, why
don't


you go over to the bar
and grab


yourself one of those girly drinks?

I'll meet


you over there.
Okay. Does anybody else want a drink?
'Cause Stuart's buying.
No, no, no. They're good. They're good.
So... They're good.
Okay.

Hey, listen, I...
We're basically already together, so...
I wasn't... I didn't even realize that.

And I was... I wouldn't... Doing anyt
hing.
Yeah.

I just want


you to grab a hold of it, tight.

Okay?
I got it.

I mean,
it's not like


you really had a chance, okay?
Security guard? Really.
But


you're a pen salesman, dude.
Yeah, and I just bought a Camry,
so


you can eat me.
All right, bro. Back off.
You know, we're all just here having fun.
Okay, bro.
What?
Hey, thanks
for getting my back there, brother.
Security blood runs deep between...
Yeah, let's just go.

Round six.
Let's
do t
his t
hing.
Gentlemen ready?
No.

Not yet. Now I'm ready. Okay.
And, go!
Leon, I can't give


you the Heimlich,
so


you better chew.
I know.
Told


you, boy. You better hurry up.
There


you go. Nachos in my face.
Oh, my God. These peppers.
The peppers

are hot.
Oh, my God. Oh, that's a hot pepper.
Nachos

are good, man.
Better inform all


your friends, boy.
Nachos about to be gone.
You're lagging be
hind.
Come on, Paul. Playing games.
I love these nachos, I'll tell


you that much.

That lemonade is insane.
Yeah, Paul.
That's because it's a margarita.
No. I
don't drink.

Twist it.
Feel the nub.

Hey,


you want some? Here.
Yeah.

You want fruit?
Bye! You blinked! You blinked.
Time to pluck the grape from the vine.
Still got the Baggies! Hot jiggity.
Coming on the left.
False alarm.
Told my mom everyt
hing about us.
What

are


you talking about?
You're acting coy. Come on. It's natural.
You know. You so know.
No, I'm sorry, Paul. I
don't know.
Snap. Pop goes the weasel.
So happy!
Yeah!
Yeah!
I believe in magic!
No way!
I'm sorry it didn't work out, dear.
It's fine, Ma.

Hey, Dad, why
don't we check for matches?
Yes.

Yeah, I
don't t
hink so, sweetheart.
I t
hink I'm just gonna turn in.
Well, how about somet
hing special
for lunch tomorrow to cheer


you up?
I
don't t
hink so, Ma. It's fine.
If somet
hing's gonna work,
it would be the sloppy joe.
But that would probably... You know.
You know, if


you're
doing the sloppy joe,

do the sweet potato fries.
But it... Whatever,


you know.
Well
done. Yeah.
Maya. Hey.
Dad. I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
There

are other fish in the sea.
You just gotta keep looking.
And it
doesn't matter what


you
do.
Because once someone takes the time
to get to know the real


you,
all bets

are off.
If it
doesn't work out,


you'll always have us.
I'm sorry, sweetie, I popped my ears.
I didn't hear a word


you were saying.
You just have to...
Is that a tattoo?
I... Yeah, yeah, it is.
When did


you get it?

I got it last night.
What is it?

It's the Loch Ness monster.
I
don't drink.

Hey.
Hi.

That was
a little weird the other night, huh?
Yeah,


you know, it had its moments. Yeah.
Was one of them
when I tried to make out with


your purse?
You see, alcohol instantly turns to sugar
in the blood.
And what happens is the capillaries...
Yeah, look. A lot of people...
Pretty much everybody,


you know, tends
to write me off.
And if


you did, too, believe me, I get it.
I just...
I guess what I'm asking is that


you
don't.
Okay. You know, I'm sorry, I've just...
I've gotta cash my paycheck
before the bank closes. I'm...
No problem.
Maybe we could talk later or somet
hing?

Yeah, sure. You could just text me, or...
Okay.
Yeah.
I can
do that. I can
do that.

You know, Paul, everybody texts these days.
I can't believe


you
don't have a cell phone.
I'm not about all t
his technology, Vijay.
I prefer face-to-face interaction
or a nice handwritten sentiment.
300 bucks?
I dug myself into a really deep hole
with t
his girl,


you gotta help me. Please.
Paul,


you've always been a straight shooter,
so I'll tell


you what.
Why
don't


you take my daughter
Parisa's phone?

No, I can't
do that.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

I'm punis
hing her.
No. What with all the parties
and that ex-boyfriend Pahud,
she went over her minutes.
When and if she decides to turn
her life around, I'll simply take it back.
Until then,


you use it.

Thanks.
Sure.
Stay wit
hin the minutes.
Of course.

Hey. It's too late to go in that way, guys.
It's closed.

No one's going in there.
Yeah. I t
hink we

are.

Hey, yo, Paul. Come here, man.
Look, I know


you been feeling
down,
so I got t
his for


you.
"The Devil's Crotch."
Feel the burn, baby.

Thanks, Leon.
Get back at me, man.
Loading
dock's ready.
Got it.

Yeah.
You need a pen,
don't


you?
You know what? No, I'm good.

I'll just use one of their pens.
Yeah,


you
do.

Yes. The Summit 5280 fountain.

That's stunning.
Yeah, I know.

How would


you like to sign


your name
with t
his panther?
You know what? More than anyt
hing.

Yeah, that'd be great.
Here. Yeah.

It's


yours. I insist.
Oh, hey, guys.

Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Don't


you just love Fridays?
Yeah.
Best night of the week.

Yeah.

Excuse me. Sorry.
Hey.

Paul. Paul, can


you help me out?
I need to shoot over to the bank
for a minute.
There's a few kids inside,
just finis
hing up their games.
Could


you close up the arcade for me?

Yeah, sure. No problem, Mr. Ferguson.
Okay.
You okay? You seem a little
down.
Yeah, I'm fine.

You know, video game might
cheer


you right up.
Nah, I'm on duty.
Welcome to the games!
Get set.
Go.
Foul. Foul.
Foul. Foul.
Foul. Foul.
Foul. Foul. Foul. Foul.
Game over.
We

are ready.
Let's
do t
his.
Attention shoppers.
Please make


your way to the ne

arest exits.
Unfortunately, the mall will be closing early.

Everybody out!
Everybody out!

Everybody out, now!
You, too!
Hi. Hey! Hey! You got me...
I'm at the West Orange Pavilion Mall.
Hey, yo. Hey, there's some crazy-ass people
trying to take over the mall.

I'm out of here.
Everybody on the floor!

Tell them to bring SWAT.
There may be hostages.
What

are


you
doing? Get
down.
Oh, my God.
Surprised? I know.
But here's the craziest part.
I'm the leader.
Reports

are, they're inside the bank
and they got hostages.
T
his is Sergeant Howard. I need four units
around the back to secure the perimeter.
See if we can establish visual.
Report back to me immediately.
Let's get all these civilians out of here.
See if we can gain access
into the loading
dock.

Go.
I'm on it. 94, move 'em out.

Hello?
Feeling alive?
I'm sorry?
Parisa.
She makes


you feel alive,
doesn't she?
T
his must be Pahud.
Pahud, no, I'm not with Parisa.
My name's Paul Blart.
Parisa's dad took her cell phone away,
and he lent it to me.
Do not lie to me, Paul Blart.
Do not lie to me.
You

are probably
sweating over her right now.
I'm not lying.
I mean, I am sweaty,
but I'm not sweating over anyone.
That woman is like an angelic goddess
who only brings goodness to t
his world.
Plus, she has some crazy sexy feet.
Paul, the pain of t
his breakup
is far too much for me to bear, man.
Pahud, no one can blame


you
for being upset.
I mean, the holidays

are tough enough
without adding heartbreak to the mix.
Wow. Them's some heavy words, Paul Blart.
Hey, life is heavy.
Indeed. Now,


you

are at the mall, huh?
So why
do


you not head over
to Orange Julius,
call up my friend Sameer Oh?
Tell
him


you

are now my homeboy.
He will hook


you up.
Wait a second.
How'd


you know I was at the mall?
I track Parisa's phone with GPS.
Don't


you judge me.
Closing time already.
Okay, there

are 223 stores in t
his mall.
Here is a list of the 15 that I need


you to
hit.
And 15 for


you.
Okay.
Now t
his is the key to retrieve the codes
from each store's credit-card mac
hine.
They change every day, so make sure
that


you bring me back the codes
for today, Friday.
Veck, six guys in standard formation,
just like


you said.
Perfect.
Bomb! Bomb! Bomb! Bomb!
And these little piggies went
all the way home.
Do it.
Gary usually delivers the leftovers
to the Mission.
Hey, everyone. A couple requests.
Kindly tie up the person beside


you,
keep


your mouths shut,
give up


your cell phones,
and as a general rule,
do as I say.
You
do all these t
hings...
Well,


you'll be back at home in no time.
Back to


your mediocre lives.

I
don't have one.
Amy.

I was hoping that


you and I could have
a whole Bonnie-and-Clyde t
hing going on.
You know, minus dying
in a hail of gunfire, of course.
What
do


you say?
Go to hell.
Ouch.
Hey, Stewie,


you
don't mind
that I'm
hitting on


your girlfriend,
do


you?
What? No. She's not my girlfriend.
But I specifically heard


you say
that


you two were "basically together."
No. I didn't say that we were together.
I said that she's into leather.
Have at it. If


you...
God,


you're an idiot.
Hello?
T
his is Sergeant Howard
of the West Orange Police Department.

Who am I speaking with?
Hi.

Yeah, well, so here's the deal.
As


you learned the hard way,
I have motion sensors by all the
doors,
so if


you wanna enter my mall,



you might as well bring
at least six body bags.
He's drilling the safe,
and they have eyes on us.
See if we can tap into the security cameras.
Now look, no one's gonna try
and enter the mall.
Is there anyt
hing


you need? Do


you need
any food? Do


you need any water?
Oh, man. T
his dude

doesn't deviate from the book at all.
You know, since


you're asking,
I would love a Happy Meal,



you know, but...
Make sure the toy is the sea monster,
'cause I already have the dragon.
Okay, okay, now what is it


you really want?
Silence.
Hey, I'm sorry, mall's closed,
but I can help


you find the ne

arest exit
if


you just tell me where


you parked.
Sweet mercy.
T
his is not happening,
t
his is not happening, t
his is...
Oh, God. All right, t
hink, Paul, t
hink.
Now what

are


you trained to
do?
Not
hing.
Detect, deter, observe, report.
I gotta report it. Reporting it.
Yo, we got a straggler.

It's a security guard.
What should we
do?

I
don't know. Give up, I guess.
Guys, what is wrong with


you?
We stick to the plan.
We got a 911 operator connecting us
with some guy named Paul Barth.
He says he's a security officer in the mall.
Hey. Blart? He's one of my guys.
Paul, t
his is Sergeant Howard
of West Orange Police Department.
The mall has been taken over,
and they have hostages.
I need


you to exit the building immediately.
We
don't need any wild cards
in t
his situation.
Copy that. Never been a wild card.
Unless


you consider the game of Uno wild.

Blart! Can we focus here,
please?
Yes. Yes, sir. On my way out.

Okay, okay. Come on,
don't
die. Don't
die.
Blart.
Don't pee. Don't pee.
Guys, motion detector just went off
at Door 26. Everybody on it.
Amy.
What the hell is he
doing? Come on!

Paul, come on!
Paulie, come on!
What's he
doing?
Come on, Blart!

Blart, come on!

Let's go! Move it!
Come on! Come on!
Get out of there!
Come on!

Is he crying?

I can't leave her.
Where's he going?
Blart!
Where's he going?

Blart, get back! Will


you talk to
him,
please?
Blart, t
his is Brooks. What's going on?
Sir, I took a sworn oath to protect t
his mall
and all inside it.
What oath? We
don't have an oath.
I sort of made up my own.
It's on a plaque in my room.
Listen, I t
hink


you're making a big mistake.
SWAT's on the way.
And I'm not gonna sugarcoat it,



you're untrained,


you're unarmed,
and let's face it, son,



you present a huge target.
With all due respect, sir,
I can't observe and report from the outside.
Over.
Well, Sergeant,
looks like


you got


your eyes on the inside.
Amy, Paul Blart here.
Are


you still in the mall?
Send.
Got
him.
Oh, my God. Oh, God.
T
hink. T
hink. T
hink, t
hink, t
hink,
t
hink, t
hink, t
hink, t
hink! T
hink!
Hold it together.
Heart of a warrior.
I missed lunch.
Thank


you.
T
his isn't happening, t
his is not happening.
Hey! Don't make t
his hard.
You like that?
Brooks, I took out a girl,
but the guy, he ran away.

Wow, Paul,


you got one.
Yes.

But let the record show,
I did not
hit a woman. I just...
I put all my weight on her.
Oh, Paul.
No, no, no. She's fine, she's fine.
Well, good, let's get


you out of there.
No can
do, sir.
I am gonna finish what I started.
What the heck is t
his?
Give me that.
Paul, t
his is Sergeant Howard again.
Since


you refuse to come out,
I'm gonna need


you to go into the bank
and find out
where they're holding the hostages.
With honor, sir.
Good to know.
Hey, I haven't heard back
from Donner or Vixen.
Okay. I'm calling an audible here, everyone.
And I need to get t
his mall locked
down
from the inside immediately.
Why
don't we just start wasting hostages?
That'll stop them.
Well, that's one way to go, but our hostages


are the only t
hing keeping the cops outside.
I'm Commander Kent. My team is deploying.
I need t
his location secured.

We got a three-block perimeter...
Establish a perimeter

and get all these people out of here.
Whoa, whoa, t
his is all
done already.
My men

are gonna
do it again, the right way.
Have


your guys fall back, now.
Have there been any demands?

A Happy Meal and absolute silence.
Well, let's make some noise.

I got snipers at the ready,
communications in check.
Let's tap into security now,
and let's get some visuals.
You can't.
They knocked out the video cameras.
I'll be ready to take on-scene command
in three, two, one. I'm in charge.
Brooks, I'm observing the bank now.
They got one assailant
guarding the hostages.
There she is.
My, God. You

are my angel pie.
Here come the love sweats.
Paul,


your radio's still on.
Roger that.

What's going on? Who is that?
We got a guy on the inside.

Don't tell me one of


your beat cops
is trying to be a hero.
No, he's neither. His name is Blart.
He's one of my security guards.

Wait a minute. Blart?
Yeah.
Paul Blart?
Yeah.

Are


you kidding me? We used to abuse
that loser in
high school. Give me that.
Blart.
T
his is Commander James Kent.
New Jersey SWAT.
We went to
high school together.
Remember?
I set


you on fire at the pancake festival?
Oh, yeah. Hey, Jimmy.
Go Green Hawks.
Yeah, listen. I've got 50
highly trained,
armed professionals out here.
At my command,
we

are retaking t
his location,
and there's no way I'm compromising
t
his mission so that some mall monitor
who used to eat lunch
with
his imaginary friend can screw it up.
Sorry, Jimmy, I had the button pressed.
All I heard was "lunch" and "friend."
Could


you
do me a favor
and put C
hief Brooks back on?
Listen to me, Blart,



you

are no longer communicating
with C
hief Brooks. Is that clear?
Hello?
Hello?
Yeah? Oh, hey, Paul, how


you
doing?
Well, it looks like they moved the hostages
into the teller

area.
I'm gonna get a closer look.
Veck.
There he is!

Everyone in the back room, now!
Come on, move, move!

Let's get in the back, huh?
Brooks. I lost visual on the hostages.
I couldn't get them out.
But I know who the leader is. It's Veck.
Veck? The trainee?

No. The brainee.
I
don't believe t
his.

I'll pass it on to Howard.
Oh, God.
Trapped is fine by me.
Commence tanning. Three, two, one.
Yeah!
Yes!
Time for some big-game hunting.
Open, open, open! Thank God.
Oh, no.
Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! We get it!
Get
him! Get
him! Get
him!
You better run.

Ru
dolph, where

are


you?
I'm about to end t
his.

Amy, huh? What a coincidence.
We got a cute little redhead

down at the bank named Amy.

Strawberry blonde, actually.
Yeah?

Well, I guess I know who I'm killing first.

Catch


you later!
Yeah?

Well, it looks like


you just ran out of mall.
It'll be over quick. She won't feel a t
hing.
You

aren't gonna touch her,
but


you

are gonna feel t
his.
Nobody wins with a head butt.

Give me


your cell phone.
I
don't have one.

What

are


you talking about?
Every kid has a cell phone.
I prefer handwritten sentiments.
Who

are these sloppy joes for?
And who gave


you t
his?
They're mine.
I'm late for my s
hift at Foot Locker.
We're getting the leader on the horn.
He wants to talk to


you.
Silence, my ass.
What's the matter?
Throw a few jabs


your way,



you curl up in a corner, suck


your thumb?
If


you
don't go toe-to-toe
with that scumbag,
he's gonna roll over on


you all night long.
It's all right. That's not my style.
Well, just in case, I wrote
down
a couple of clever comebacks, like...
Here.
T
his is what


you been
doing?
"Yeah,


you and what army?"

What's wrong with that?
He has an army.

Everyone deserves a card on their birthday.
So when


you and Ru
dolph
were laug
hing it up back at the crib
about how easy all t
his was gonna be,
were


you guys like,
"Man, any brain-dead mall cop
that gets in the way is gonna get smoked"?
And then... And then what?
You guys all
high-fived?

Veck, t
his guard is...
Winning! I know t
his, because I am all set!

But sadly, no codes!
And I'd say, considering
all the luxury items that I have stacked up
in my Amazon shopping cart,
situation unacceptable!
No, no, no, no, no, no. He looking.
Give me a gun.
Put it
down. Put it
down.
What

are


you nodding about?
I was just wondering,
were


you serious about that Happy Meal?
It isn't coming, is it?
What?
T
his is Commander James Kent,
New Jersey SWAT.
You wanted to speak to me?
I just wanna make sure
that no one
does anyt
hing stupid.
You should know my men

are deployed
and ready to bring t
his t
hing to a resolution.
The easy way or the hard way.
That is such a tough call, but...
Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and go with C,
none of the above!
I'm Amy, by the way.

Amy? From unbeWEAVEable?
Yeah.

I'm Maya.
My father talked forever about


you.
And I gotta say, he really
does like


you.
I'm gonna throw up.
Oh, that's not so bad.
Oh, my God.
They've got
his daughter.

Dad?
Maya.
Everyt
hing's gonna be okay.
How's


your blood sugar?

Don't worry about me, okay?
I'm worried about


you.
I love


you.
All right, now, I'm gonna get


you all out.
You just hang in there, okay, sweetie?
I will. I'm a Blart, remember?
Yeah. I'll see


you soon.
I'm supposed to be on my way
to the Cayman Islands with the hostages.
And where the hell is Ru
dolph?
He should be back by now.
"If Veck gets the codes,
he's taking us to Cayman Islands"?
Well, Veck Sims, welcome to the show.
Come and get me, Veck.
I got


your codes
for the credit-card mac
hines.

Yo,


you hear that? That's Paul, baby!
Blart?

That's who's been screwing all t
his up?
You have got to be kidding me.
Give me a radio.
Let me tell


you somet
hing.
You take hostages in my mall,



you

are making a big mistake.
You seriously undermissed...
And


you seriously...
Oh, no!
Blart?
Sugar. Sugar.
Blart? You there, Blart?
Hello, Blart. You there?
Hey, Blart!
I was hoping we could get an ETA
of when


you're gonna give up.
How about now?
I'll meet


you on the corner of Ne and Ver.
Yeah,


you heard me. Never!
All right, Dad.
Hey, fellas! You looking for me?
Come on. Come on, come on. Come on.
Follow me.
There he is.
We got
him trapped in Rainforest Cafe.
Great. Wait for me.
You know, my mom always said,
"If


you want somet
hing
done right,
waste the guy


yourself."
I'm paraphrasing, of course. You stay here.
Prancer, take the back.
Hey,


you. Scuba Dooby-Doo.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Can I have my codes now,
please?
Why? No codes, no Cayman Islands?
Looks like Paul Blart turned into
quite the badass.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Relax.
No.
One t
hing I know is
Paul Blart is not a badass.
Comet! Don't come back till he's dead!
Brooks. Only one more left.
Then it's just me and Veck.
Okay, who's talking to Blart?
Was it


you, sugar mouth?
All right. Let's try t
his again.
Wait! No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no!
It's her phone, it's hers.
She's talking to
him.
She's talking to
him, and I told her not to.
And it's under her leg.
The phone. Her right leg. Right there.
That's good.
Okay.
That was close.
He is a pro.
Listen, Blart, time's up. We're busting in.
Wait! Look, Veck's after
the credit-card codes, and I got them.
Just give me a few minutes.
No problem.
Isn't that cute?

Hey, Amy. I'm on my way.
Oh, hey, Blart.

Wow. Our boy Stuart just turned me on
to


your profile
on lonelyloser.com.
"Likes morning rain, walks on the beach."
Who

are


you, Olivia Newton-John?
I was just speaking from the heart.
Yeah, well, I didn't have to go online, Paul,
to know that


you love peanut brittle.
You're so pathetic.
Trippy.
T
his I can use.
What
do


you want, Veck?
I just want the $30 million
that I came here for.
But,


you know, I would settle offing



your dream girl, or maybe


your daughter.
You touch them, I
swear I'll end


you.
What're


you gonna
do, Paul?
You gonna pull up with


your left
hip forward
giving the illusion that


you have a gun,
w
hich


you and I both know


you
don't?

I could.
You're not gonna
do squat.

The next time I see


you, Paul,
I'm gonna put a bullet in


your head.
I
don't t
hink so. I'm taking


you
down.
Blart!
Oh, Blart.
Sweet mercy.
I wish I had a bat. I would bust


you open,
see how much candy fell out.

Too tight!
T
his is not happening.
It's not happening.
Come on.

Bravo. That was awesome.
And


you were just so close
to making it, too, Paul. Just so close.

It's not over yet.
Yeah, I t
hink it is.

Now the only t
hing I need

are my codes,
w
hich, judging from


your text messages,



you have been so sweet as to enter them
into


your phone just for me.
You t
hink I'm gonna carry the phone
with me that actually contains the...

Yello?
Peanut Blart and Jelly.

What's up, man?
So good to hear


your voice.
Yeah, it's good to hear



your voice, too, Pahud.
Listen, I'm gonna have to call


you back.

What? When?
I
don't know when. I'll talk to


you later.

Okay, Paul, call me back!
Call me back, Paul!
I mean,
t
his just keeps getting better and better.
I mean,


you

are impossible
to underestimate.
I mean,


you can't pass the trooper exam,



you black out if


you
don't have
a Snickers bar like every 20 minutes,



you had the chance to be the MVP,
and


you blew it.
Again, like


you always
do.
Ain't that right, Maya?
What
do


you want me to say, Veck?
You're smarter than me.
You're good on computers,



you kept


your weight under control.
I mean, people,
they look at me and


you, and...
Yeah, it's a landslide.
It's no contest.
Sorry.
Right now,


you're the man with the gun.
So here


you go.
Come on!
Go get
him!
Go, Dad.
What...
Probably should have capitalized on that.
Dad!
Lock and load, boys. We're going in.
Hey, we're on the move.
Let's go.
Come on, come on, come on.
Paul. T
hink, Paul. T
hink!
Let's go, men. Take it
down.
Secure the suspects.
Get
down!
Hold


your fire! Hold


your fire!
Down. The other one. That's the back one.
No, no. That's the same one. No!
The other one!
Veck got away with my daughter and Amy.
Entry team, clear the mall. We'll pursue.
Light.
Open the
door.
Let's
do t
his.
Jimmy, give me


your cell phone.
Gotta hand it to


you, Blart.
You're really taking c

are of business.
What up?
Pahud,
do


you still have GPS
on Parisa's cell phone?
You know I
do, Paul. You know I
do.
What can I
do for


you?
I need to know where it's headed.
Paul, it looks like
they're on their way to McGuire Airfield.
I know where that is. Thanks.
Hang on.
My God. There they

are.
Jimmy, take the wheel.
What?
Here we go! Here we go!
That was me. I can't...
Here I go! No!
Blart!
Don't
do it! Blart!
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Maya! Maya, get inside.

Oh, God!
Dad!

Paul?
I really
don't drink.
Come on. Oh, yeah?

Dad!
Come on.

Dad!
Man, that hypoglycemia is a killer.
I told


you I'd take


you
down.
Blart!
Very impressive,
taking
down an assailant without a gun.
I hope


you
don't mind if I use one.
What?

Oh, no.
Oh, yeah.

I guess
it's off to the Cayman Islands then, huh?
Soon as I get my money.
Yeah, well,


you'll be needing t
his.
Just give it to
him, Dad.
Oh, I will. Suck on that!
Okay. Situation update?
We have seven assailants in custody, sir.

Great. Nobody talks to them but me.
Yes, sir.

You see, jackass? I
don't need the phone.
'Cause I got all the access codes
written on their arm.
Now, I kill


you three,
there'll be no witnesses.
And since everybody t
hinks
t
his was a bank...
I got a newsflash for


you.
Your flight's been canceled.
That's better than anyt
hing I got.
You did good, Dad.
Yeah, I am pretty great.
You know, she
doesn't need a green card.
I
don't know what to say.
I have somet
hing I want to say to


you.
Happy birthday, Amy.
I heard


you applied to be a state trooper.
You say the word,
my department would be proud to have


you.
Thank


you, sir. But I t
hink
I'm gonna stick with what I
do best.
It's protecting the people
of the West Orange Pavilion Mall.

Let's
do some math. There

are 9,211 words in the bee movie script. The word "Bee" is said throughout the movie 173 times. 173 x 9,211 is 1,593,503 So if the original script has 9,211 words, minus out the bee there will be 8,938 words Adding 1,593,503 to 8,938,


you will get 1,602,441 words in


your requested script If


you read 4 words per second, it would take one 4.6 days to read it all without stopping.

ALL credit goes to /u/Tocinos, I just copypasta'd.
Sorry D:

When I was a boy I would lay naked outside and cover myself in sugar letting all the ants crawl over me. There was not
hing I loved more than being in the grass feeling their legs on my skin wis
hing I could one day be small enough to join their colony. Every now and then I would feel adventurous and lay with the larger ants, the ones that could bite. The following days my body would ache but I knew they were just being friendly and it was all love. Although it has been a few years since I last visited those ants I still yearn for their touch and have found other ways to deal with my urges. In another life I will be reunited with them and we shall live together and I will be truly happy.

high-tailin' towards 'yer IP so

you call livin'. Youre fucking buzzard food, pard'ner. I reckon to be anywhere, anytime, and I can lay


you out in over seven hunn'ed ways, and thats just with my Arkansas Toothpick. Not only am I experienced in dueling, but I have access to all the big irons the Texas Rangers could afford, and I will use it to its full extent to wipe


your knee
high to a lamb ass off the face of the Mississippi,


you little saphead. If only


you could have reckoned what unholy retribution


your quip was about to bring

you couldnt,


you didnt, and now


youre paying the price,


you gaw'durn varmint. I will stomp fury all over y'all and

Why the fuck

Do british people actually exist?
I mean, they must be a meme, there is a not a single t
hing about them. And I mean it. Let's go through the evidence:

Where

are they from?

Not a single country in the world is named Britain. Some people say they come from England, and England is inside Britain, but if that was the case they would be British they would be Englanders.
Also, heard some silly theories about them coming from whales. Guys, no, whale people
do not exist. Whales live in the sea.
Do there is a consensus on british people coming from Europe, but then we

are left with a whole continent of possible locations. That's as good as not
hing.

What
do they eat?

Every country has at least one main dish. Even the US has their burgers. But these british people, what
do they eat? Heard some people associating them with tea, but everyone knows that's an Asian t
hing. Shouldn't they come from Europe? One of these two points must be wrong them. To me, it looks too sketchy.

What language
do they speak?

I challenge


you, putting all my money and my ass on the line here, to find a supposed ""british"" person speaking their native language. Most of then just speak a broken ENGLISH. Yes, english. Really suspicious, huh?
And I even tried to look deeper into it. Maybe british just SOUND like english, just like spanish could sound like portuguese for a non-speaker. So I looked up "british dictionary on google" and what I found was shocking: every word in there was AMERICAN. I kid


you not.
What t
his could mean is beyond my capabilities, but I can safely assure


you that british people
do not exist.

Chess is a crappy tactical turn based RPG developed by a bunch of monkeys.
Right away


you'll notice Chess has no storyline. Instead, all


you notice is the the W
hite army and the Black army

are fighting each other over a battlefield. Note the "a battlefield," because Chess only has one story map.
As for the actual combat, it's extremely dull. Each unit can kill another with only one
hit. T
his means units with a real good movement ability
dominate the field (more on that bellow). There

aren't even any combat animations or anyt
hing that happens in combat. One unit moves on it's space and "captures" it, and the piece is removed from the game with no form of action or special effects.
Yawn.
Chess has s
hitty class balance. The Queen is flat out overpowered w
hile


your actual front line units, the Pawns. can't
do s
hit. I t
hink the developers were afraid that no one would use the female character so they buffed up her abilities really
high but now theres no point in using any other unit.
The rest of the units suck. Rooks can only move in 4 directions, same with Bishops. Boring. Also, whats up with the Knight? It has the most bizz

are combat abilities of all the units. They're retardly hard to use cause they jump around like retards to move and attack. The devs should have named t
his unit Ninja, since Knights didn't jump around like that in real life.
Worst part, is the king. You see, the devs decided that if


your king gets captured,


you instantly lose the game. W-T-F? T
his wouldn't be a problem, except that he can't move for crap. Seriously, the most important unit in the game can only move 1 space a turn? Good luck keeping
him alive w
hile every other unit in the game dances around
him.
Unbalanced classes, lackluster gameplay, and not to mention repetitive 1 hour+ games. Chess is not worth the time or


your money. Buy Final Fantasy Tactics or Disgaea instead.

Peach is the reason I work out. I have t
his fantasy where we start talking at Mushroom Castle. We exchange a few pleasantries. She asks what I
do. I say I loved her cake. She laughs. I get my drink.
"Well, see ya," I say and walk away. I've got her attention now. How many guys voluntarily leave a conversation with Princess Peach? She touches her neck as she watches me leave.
Later, as the night's dragged on and the coterie of drunk Toads grows increasingly loose, she finds me on the balcony, my bowtie un
done, smoking a cig

arette.
"Got a sp

"What's in it for me?" I say as I hand her one of my little w

"Conversation with me, duh."
I laugh.
"What's so funny?" she protests.
"Not
hing, not
hing... It's just...
don't


you grow tired of the kidnappings?"
"You get used to it," she says, lighting her cig

arette and handing me back the lighter.
"What would


you
do if


you weren't a princess?" I ask.
"Teac
hing, I t
hink."
"And if I was


your student, what would I be learning?"
"Discipline," she says quickly, looking up into my eyes, before changing the subject. "Where

are


you from?"
"Sand King
dom," I say.
"Oh wow. That's lovely."
"It's ok," I admit. "Not everyt
hing is to my liking."
"What could possibly be not to


your liking in Sand King
dom?" she inquires.
"I
don't like sand," I tell her. "It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere."

I sexually Identify as wanting to
die. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of making a noose and stand large enough to end my sad life. People say to me that a person wanting to
die is Impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I
don't c

are, I'm dead inside. I'm having a surgeon install AIDS, 30 types of cancer and failing organs into me. From now on I want


you guys to call me "dead" and respect my right to
die at anytime and commit suicide. If


you can't accept me


you're a necrophobe and need to check


your living privilege. Thank


you for being so understanding.

Uh, I t
hink


you'll find that was the Mii Channel and not Wii Sports. Whereas t
his post clearly states right here http://i.imgur.com/AHeI6ey.png that it sounds like the Wii Sports theme w
hich


you can find HERE and not the Mii Channel theme w
hich sounds like THIS. I'd like to t
hink anyone with half a brain could tell the difference.
And I
don't expect anyone who
doesn't know what the Wii Sports theme sounds like to be able to click a URL to take them to YouTube in order to listen so


you just need to click big word that says "HERE" like so. If


you have any issues getting off the next junction on the information super
highway then shoot me a PM. But
please
don't mix up


your Wii music, and I
don't mean the GAME. But I guess I wouldn't expect someone like


you to have the taste in games to know what Wii Music actually is.
I mean, Jesus Christ sometimes I feel like I'm walking into a dementia filled old people's home.

I was on my regular thot patrol last night.
So I saw t
his bright light.
I said
"That must be a thot's party"
So I went to check on it
There was only one thotless man standing there
My nigga
Jesus Christ
He came
down to me
He said
"My son"
"You have been thotless all


your life"
"I shall give


you t
his knowledge"
He said to me
"If she breath, she a thot"
And I live by those words

wow congrats dude, really, that's very cool. i just told everyone in my family about it, everybody t
hinks that's very impressive and asked me to congratulate


you. they want to speak to


you in person, if possible, to give


you their regards. they also said they will tell our distant relatives in christmas supper and in NYE they will ignite fireworks that spell


your name. i also told about t
his enormous deed to closer relatives, they had the same reaction. they asked for


your address so they can send congratulatory cards and messages. my friends didn't believe me when i told them i knew the author of t
his gigantic feat, really, they were dumbstruck, they said they will make


your name echo through years and years to come. when my neighbour found out about what


you did, he was completely dumbstruck too, he wanted to know who


you

are and he asked (if


you have the time, of course) if


you could stop by to receive gifts, congratulations and handshakes. with the spreading of the news, a powerful businessman of the

area decided to
hire


you as the CEO of
his company because of t
his tremen
dous feat and at the same time an important international sh

areholder wants to sponsor


you to give speeches and teach everybody how to
do as


you did so the world becomes a better place.


you have become famous not only here but also everywhere, everybody knows who


you

are. the news spread really fast and mayors of all cities

are setting up porticos, ballons, colossal boom speakers, anyt
hing that can make


your name stand out more and see w
hich city can congratulate


you the hardest for t
his magnificent feat. here in my city, all the streets will be renamed after


you beginning at the next mayoral term. a lot of countries that frowned upon ours, now, thanks to


your deed, see us as a role model, a new hope. the lucky people who know about


you say "hey, that guy is my compatriot!" and everybody shouts immediately after them "YES, YES, YES!


yours is a good country". thanks to that, tourism has exploded, everybody came here thanks to


you, the inflow of international currency was huge, making our stockmarket take off and making our country the pillar for the solution of internation economic crisis. thanks to that, we

are seen as role models, and we have surpassed the US and become the richest and most powerful nation in the world. all the logging companies were very moved by


your deed and collectively decided to stop deforesting the tropical rainforests so the human race can thrive in t
his planet more and more. the worldwide chaos due to the election of
donald trump in the usa has ceased due to the fact that they

are no longer the most powerful nation in the world. the Pope has sent
his preachers all over the world to speak of


your name and


your deeds so


you work is known by every creature that walks on the surface of t
his planet. also, because of


you, the scientists at CERN have decided to stop experimenting with the large hadron collider, since the origins of the universe
don't matter anymore comparing to the magnitude of


your feat. the Mayans came back from the Andromeda galaxy and said


you were the reason they decided to let us live beyond the year 2012.


your feat was so incredible it ejected the alpha celestial body that was inhabiting the earth's orbit and threatening to destroy it. because of


you, Akira Toryama decided to continue the dragon ball sagas, t
his time with a character in


your honor.  every  tv show host, at the end of their show, now sends greetings to the whole country and one specially to


you. keep on alway being t
his wonderful, hard working, beautiful, inspiring, manificent, good spirited, creative etc. person and always keep on
doing stuff life t
his. Kept it up dude, and the world will be more and more a better place to live.

As a brony, now I understand how the Jews felt during the Holocaust, and how negroes during slavery. T
his violent persecution of the Brony lifestyle in unacceptable and needs to be brought to attention of the United Nation's Human Rights Council.

I'm a slave master, and t
his is my plantation. I work here with my niggers and my slave driver, Big Nigg. Everyone in here has chains and a collar. One t
hing I've learned after 21 years -


you never know w
hich nigger will try to escape.

My dad
died in a car crash recently. I hacked into
his computer looking for photos etc and found out he was cheating on my mom, exchanging masturbation videos and endlessly chatting and
doing cybersex with some woman in Denmark. There was even what looked like strong evidence of plans to take a trip there.
I got rid of all the evidence. Nobody else in my family knows. He took it to
his grave and so will I.
I talked to the woman via
his skype account to tell her he was dead. She asked if I'd send some of the videos of
him that she hadn't saved, that he would send almost every morning of
him walking into work telling her he loved her. I told her they had been deleted. She said I shouldn't have
done that without t
hinking of how she would feel at the news.
If my mom and brother ever found out, he would probably
dox her, go to Denmark and kill her.
But he won't, because I'm taking it to my grave.

Seriously? After 20 minutes of getting to choke t
his gorgeous girl with


your cock, two little poots of cum is all


you could manage? Pathetic. I registered and account just so I could comment in hopes that I  can make


you see how selfish


you

are. Fronting like some alpha-male w
hile Elizabeth is performing her heart out, and what
do


you give her? Two little twiddlywinks of cum? Pathetic. I've never felt more personally offended by porn before. You're a real asshole, pal.

iDubbbzTV is my favorite LGBT YouTuber, and is a true activist for LGBTQ+ rights in America. Our racist, homophobic, w
hite-supremacist, republican, judaphobic, xenophobic president, known as "Donald J. Drumpf" t
hinks he can kill all LGBT people, but not when we have amazing activists like iDubbbz standing up for LGBT community members! Just
his bravery is amazing, the way he was not afraid to say that he's truly "gay!" when
his friend told
him to jump
down and say some gay s

I was in science class when a call came into our sub, I won't forget the look on her face when she looked up and told us that club panguin was gone. After that everyone started talking about it and those who knew those who were still online frantically checked there phones to see if anyones peinguin made it out alive. I personally
do not know anyone who was on the server when it shut
down but I feel sorry for those who
do.

One time my mother called me a son of a bitch, so I
hit her because no one talks trash about my mother, then I
hit myself because no one
hits my mother, she then
hit me because no one
hits her son and then
hit herself because no one
hits me, so I
hit her because no one
hits my mother. cant stop me

Basically like in t
his video:  https://www.

Math class. Back in
high school, I had t
his insane crush on one of my math teachers.
Every time I had her for class, I was never able to focus on the work. I had a raging hard-on for 40 minutes straight. It ached like hell, but given the respect I had for her, I tried to
hide it as much as possible.
One day, however, was worse than usual. My dick was twitc
hing so much it felt like it was going to explode. Slowly but surely, I pulled my zipper
down and took out my cock. Pre-cum dribbled like a leaky faucet onto the tile floor; I moved my hand up and
down the shaft. I imagined Ms. Averty's moist lips wrapped around my cock. Fucking ecstasy. And then, I-
"Are


you fucking jacking off?"
S
hit. Someone noticed. I spun my entire body around, meat-stick still in hand, and unleashed my creamy load right into t
his nerd's agape mouth. He screamed and gagged in disgust, coug
hing up semen in warm, steaming chunks. But that only made me harder.
I ram my swollen fuck-stick into
his virginial asshole. It isn't Ms. Averty, but it'll
do. Blood and darkened brown fluid, probably diarrhea, oozed
down the shaft of my member. With each thrust of my midsection, I slammed my fist into
his face, the knuckles cut from
his t
hick-rimmed glasses. I felt another climax approac
hing, gave one final triumphant thrust into
his slophole, and busted the largest nut of my life into
his slumped, lifeless corpse.
And then I realized what I had
done.
When I told my mother what happened, her eyes glossed over and st

ared over my shoulder. She couldn't even bear to look at me. A few phone calls later, and I was off the hook. I've only met my dad a few times, but he must be in an extreme state of power if I could get out of a situation like that so easily.
She told me that I was moving
down south for aw
hile. I pleaded with her to let me stay, but she had already made up her mind. I couldn't believe it. I got in one little fight and my mom got sc

ared. She said, "You're moving with


your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air."

I sexually Identify as a Hit Disney Chanel Original Movie. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of having a beautiful, w
hitewashed cast with one black guy and one Asian. People say to me that being both a Disney Channel Original Movie and a "
hit" is Impossible and I'm stupid but I
don't c

are, I'm beautiful. I'm having a plastic surgeon install crappy writing and the same four chords on my body. From now on I want


you guys to call me DCOM and respect my right to make the same movie over and over again. If


you can't accept me


you're a disneyphobe and need to check


your cinimatic privilege. Thank


you for being so understanding.

do


you t
hink if Linguini sleeps in underwear, he lets Remy inside the underwear and sleeps on
his crotch, using
his weewee as a teddy bear
or even better if they're feeling adventurous
Linguini lets Remy crawl into
his asshole and lets
him sleep in the warm and moist cavern

As a 24 year old single female I t
hink it's very hard to find a guy who's actually interested in free softw

are.
I've had guys jokingly ask to "Netflix and C
hill" but when I tell
him that I
don't use Netflix since Netflix requires proprietary softw

are to stream content,
they stop talking to me. And worse if they
do stay they t
hink I'm weird since I blocked Google IP's in my host file and we can't even watch YouTube.
I can't text them either. Once I get their numbers since I've added custom roms to my phone and refuse to use sms since it's a security concern
I require all of my friends to
download a free and open source messaging app and I sh

are with them my public PGP key so that we can verify our conversations


are secure. None of my friends

are willing to
do t
his. And I can't use sites like tinder since it's not proprietary softw

are but a major privacy vulnerability.
How come it is so hard to find a guy concerned about softw

are free
dom? I feel like I'm going to be single forever.

Copied and pasted in all its glory. T
his guy was 1000% serious.
Uh huh. Keep telling


yourself that. Keep talking s
hit about people


you
don't know on the internet. It's a nice safe t
hing to
do. No one will beat the fuck out of


you on the internet for running


your fucking mouth. That's why


you retreat here to
do it.
For the record, I'm not a homophobe. I
don't have any problem with a person's sexual preferences and my dick is just fine. It gets me off every single time (I actually have a very satisfying monogamous sex life with a beautiful woman who also has no problem getting off, but just to make sure I am satisfying her I
don't let myself come until she has several times). Truth be told if I had the option I may add a little girth to it if I could but I
don't t
hink it's necessary and I certainly
don't lose sleep over it.
The question is what the fuck is wrong with a bitch like


you that


you come on to a social media sight and throw insults at large blocks of people and then act enraged when someone slings an offhand insult back at


you? Fuck off man. Start going out in public and making


your insults to people's faces. Pathetic motherfucker

what the fuck is the point in correcting me. You t
hink I
don't know how to spell "


your"? I shortened it to "ur" because I was eating c
hips and typing one handed and didn't want to bother with those 2 extra letters just to
please a fucking lifeless fat neckbeard like


you.
Stop t
hinking


you're smart just because


you can correct somebody's spelling,


you seem like a total fucking idiot jackass and I'm ashamed and disappointed that on the internet where there

are millions of comments and commentors, I was still stuck with a response written by somebody like


you.
You obviously knew what I meant, it's not like I spelt "


your" as "s;ldkfjs;dlfkj". Take


your fucking dil
do keyboard out


your crusty ass and realize that maybe


you have no friends and plans tonight because


you're an unlikeable cumstain who repels everybody away like opposite poles on a magnet.
The next time


you comment like a fucking moron, ask


yourself "would I rather write t
his useless comment or would I rather clean my fucking act up and stop being a little s
hitter". My New Years resolution is to never have the misfortune of


you coming across any more of my comments and throwing up


your s
hitty insight at me.

Infinite poop. You sit on the toilet to poop, but the poop never stops coming out of


your butt. You have to start flus
hing the toilet every two minutes to keep up. You try to pinch


your butt closed but that makes


your insides hurt. The poop accelerates. You call 911. The paramedics call for
doctors. The
doctors call for specialists. The story trends on Twitter. You turn
down talk show appearances. Your septic tank fails. People form a cult. Your toilet is finished. Volunteers arrive with buckets and shovels. You

are completely used to the smell. The poop accelerates. You

are moved to a stepladder with a hole in the top step. The poop accelerates. The shovelers aban
don the buckets and shovel directly out the win
dow. The poop accelerates. A candlelight vigil forms around


your house. One of the workers falls over and can't free
himself. The poop accelerates. A priest knocks over the stepladder and tackles


you out the win
dow. You land in the pile. The poop accelerates. The force now propels


you forward and upward. Vigil goers grab at


your legs. The poop ignites from their candles. The Facebook live event
hits 1 million viewers. The poop accelerates. You

are 30 feet in the air. The fire engulfs the vigil and


your house. 60 feet. The poop accelerates. The torrent underneath


you is deafening. 5 million Facebook live viewers. You try to close up shop but


your butthole disintegrated long ago. 120 feet up. Your house explodes. The poop accelerates. 1000 feet. You

are now tracked on radar. You try to change


your angle of ascent but


you should have thought of that way earlier. The poop accelerates. 4,000 feet. NORAD upgrades to DEFCON 3. Concentric circles of fire engulf


your city. The poop accelerates. You have broken the sound barrier. 30,000 feet. You no longer take in enough oxygen to sustain consciousness. 60,000 feet. CNN is reporting on all the world records


you've broken. 200,000 feet. You

are no longer alive. The poop accelerates. Your body disintegrates but


your poop contrail remains. NASA can no longer track


you. You break the light-speed barrier and we can no longer bear witness. The poop accelerates. Forever.

Heh... not bad, kid. Not bad at all. Your meme, I mean. It's not bad. A good first attempt. It's plenty dank... I can tell it's got some thought be
hind it... lots of quotable material... But memeing isn't all suns
hine and rainbows, kid. You're skilled... that much I can tell. But
do


you have what it takes to be a Memester? To join those esteemed meme ranks? To call


yourself a member of the Ruseman's Corps? Memeing takes talent, that much is true. But more than that it takes heart. The world-class Memesters - I mean the big guys, like Johnny Hammersticks and Billy Kuahana - they're out there day and night, burning the midnight meme-oil, working tirelessly to craft that next big meme. And


you know what, kid? 99 times out of a hundred, that new meme fails. Someone dismisses it as bait, or says it's "tryhard," or ignores it as they copy/paste the latest s
hitpost copypasta dreamt up by those sorry excuses for cut-rate memers over at reddit. The Meme Game is rough, kid, and I

A man gets on a bus, and ends up sitting next to a very attractive nun. Enamored with her, he asks if he can have sex with her. Naturally, she says no, and gets off the bus. The man goes to the bus driver and asks
him if he knows of a way for
him to have sex with the nun. "Well," says the bus driver, "every night at 8 o'clock, she goes to the cemetery to pray. If


you dress up as God, I'm sure


you could convince her to have sex with


you." The man decides to try it, and dresses up in
his best God costume. At eight, he sees the nun and appears before her. "Oh, God!" she exclaims. "Take me with


you!" The man tells the nun that she must first have sex with
him to prove her loyalty. The nun says yes, but tells
him she prefers anal sex. Before


you know it, they're getting
down to it, having nasty, grunty, loud sex. After it's over, the man pulls off
his God disguise. "Ha, ha! I'm the man from the bus!" "Ha, ha!" says the nun, removing her costume. "I'm the bus driver!"

Alright, as we all know u/Cummybot2000 has gone missing. We all miss Cummy very much, but where did they go?
I believe I have some answers, friends. T
his was the last post Cummy had ever commented on. As


you can see it's a Pro-Trump pasta. I believe there's some sort of Anti-Trump conspiracy at work here. But there's more.
Roughly around the same time that u/Cummybot2000 disappe

ared the prodigal son
himself, u/waterguy12, came back to Reddit. Coincidence? Perhaps. But let's look at the big picture here.
If


you

are unfamiliar with the legend of Waterguy12, look here. Notice that Cummy was absent in t
his thread as well. We're starting to see a pattern.
u/waterguy12 has somet

do with the disappearance of u/cummybot2000. Somet
hing is very wrong here. I
don't know what Waterguy12, and perhaps the other Guy12s, have
done with our Cummy but I'm not going to just stand by and let them
do it. I'm going to take the fight to them. Wish me luck, fellow Pastafarians.

Ich bin A

I'm an up-and-coming producer in hollywood. After years of working on small in
die projects, I finally
hit my big break. Once I made a bit of a name for myself, I was invited to all the fancy parties with the glittering starlets and famous directors. At one gala, I had a bit too much to drink, and needed to cool
down.
I went outside onto the balcony, surveying the cityscape w
hile leaning against the railing. I initially thought I was all alone out there with my thoughs on that c
hilly December evening, but much to my surprise, Emma Stone was sitting on a bench. She looked so beautiful, wearing a lowcut sea green gown that perfectly complimented her smoldering eyes. Utterly enchanting.
Normally I would never approach someone so famous, but emboldened by the liquor in my veins, I made my way over to her.
"Evening," I said, in what I hoped was not a completely starstruck tone.
"How's it going," she replied distantly. Sadness tinged her voice, and I could tell she was not enjoying herself tonight.
"I know


you must hear t
his all the time, but


you look absolutely stunning tonight," I said. For a brief moment, a smile flitted across her face, cutting through her melancholy.
A gust of c
hill wind blew across the balcony, and Emma s
hivered. It was unusually cold for Los Angeles, and her dress would not
do her much good outside. I removed my suit jacket, offering it to her. She accepted it gratefully, draping the jacket across her shoulders.
"You can sit
down if


you want," she told me, patting next to her on the bench.
I lowered myself next to her. I was perfectly fine with sitting there in silence, but to my surprise she began to make conversation. We spoke about light, inconsequential topics for an over an hour. Our favorite restaurants, hobbies, that sort of t
hing. I even managed to make her laugh a few times, and what a laugh it was. The liquor had no effect on me any more; I was intoxicated by t
his beautiful, lovely, witty woman who for some reason seemed to enjoy my company.
"You seemed a bit forlorn when I first came out here, Emma," I said eventually. "Is everyt
hing okay?"
She sighed. "It's not
hing, really. I wouldn't want to trouble


you with somet
hing so mundane."
"It's no trouble at all."
She bit her lower lip. "I got into a bit of an argument with my manager. I told
him I wanted to take a break from movies and star in a TV show, but he told me it would be ridiculous. I know it's silly and that I've been plenty successful on the big screen. It's just that movies

are so short. Two hours, three at the most. I want somet
hing where I can develop my character over the years, perfecting the subtle nuances and evolving over time."
"It makes sense," I assured her. "You want to try somet
hing different, a new challenge to embark on to really make use of


your talents."
"Exactly!" she exclaimed, eyes lighting up. "You get me. I know I've only just met


you James, but I feel like I've known


you for a long, long time." She moved in closer to me, and I took a chance, draping my arm around her delicate shoulders. Emma did not seem to mind. No, quite the opposite in fact. She leaned into me, resting her head on my upper arm.
"So what kind of show would


you like to be on?" I asked.
Emma looked up, her eyes meeting mine. "Oh, somet
hing epic. Game of Thrones is my favorite show right now, so I'd love be on somet
hing of that magnitude. What about


you, James? What's


your favorite show?"
"Rick and Morty," I told her.
"I've tried to watch it, but it just wasn't really my t
hing," Emma said. She began to trace her finger on my chest, but I slapped it away, standing up abruptly. Red rage clouded my vision.
"To be fair," I decl

ared intensely,"


you have to have a very
high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's ni
hilistic outlook, w
hich is deftly woven into
his characterisation -
his personal p
hilosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand t
his stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say somet
hing deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," w
hich itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratc
hing their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no,


you cannot see it. It's for the smart la
dies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're wit
hin 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand."
After I finished my tirade, Emma looked stunned and hurt. But I did not c

are. Her beauty and charm had evaporated before my very eyes, and all that was left was an uncultured harlot not worthy of my attentions. Without another word, I left the party, never to see Emma again. Good riddance.

If, according to Kanye West, one good girl is worth a thousand bitches, and if, according to Lil Wayne, bitches come a dime a
dozen,
does that mean one good girl is worth $8.33?
Well, $8.35 in Canada.
In Thailand, $8.33 is about 275 Baht. 275 Baht will get


you a skanky hooker in a Thai brothel. If


you want a really good hooker, it'll cost


you at least 2000 Baht, or about $61.00. So in Thailand a good woman is worth $61.00 or $732 a
dozen.
Yes. However to further t
his, according to 2Pac Mo' Money= Mo' Bitches If


you divide out Mo',


you will see that money=bitches Therefore, 1000 moneys= one good girl.
To extrapolate further, diving with respect to "money" yields 1 money = $0.00833 T
his changes everyt
hing, because money isn't worth hardly anyt
hing.
True. A linear relations
hip between money and bitches means the equation relating money to bitches is in the form of y=ax+b, where x is money and y is bitches. Consulting the Lil Wayne theorem, if 12 bitches is worth $0.10, then one bitch is $0.0083. Therefore we know that the equation 1=a(.0083)+b must hold true and so must 12=a(.1)+b. To find the equation relating money to bitches must have "a" and "b" values w
hich satisfy the two previous equations. Since "Mo'" implies a positive linear relation, we know "a" must be positive. I have
done the math for


you and found that a=119.96 and b=.0043. So, (Bitches)=119.96(Money)
+ .0043. To find the number of good girls


you get from an amount of money, simply divide the number of bitches by 1000 (because of the Kanye West Theorem).
No but biggie said mo' money= mo' problems so money=problems and since mo' money mo' bitches, we can see that bitches=problems
Well one must first consult the "50 Cent Law": "Mo' Money, Mo' Problems". Here we see that the amount of money is proportionate to the number of problems. Then one must factor one of the basic rules of the "The Carter Theorem" : "I got 99 problem but a bitch ain't one". Here we see that without a "bitch" the average person will have exactly 99 problems. Therefore the formula must be applied: (current amount of money) (8.33) / ln[(Problems100-1 ) * (current amount of money)]bitches = worth of bitch Unfortunately t
his formula only tells us the value "a bitch" w
hich as we know is only worth one monies Therefore


you must apply [(worth of bitch) * (problems) * (money-8.33)]
+ 1 / 1000 = The value of a good girl Hope t
his helps
Yeah. No. That's not how math works. 2pac was merely stating that the derivative of Money in terms of Bitches is strictly positive. More-over, he skipped a lot of steps in
his proof and never formally published the full version. I bet


you believed Fermat's margins really were too small as well, right?
Imperial bitches is actually a unit of weight. An imperial bitch is ~111.1111111112 pounds.
Theres one fundamental law of math that Lil'Wayne forgot to include in
his calculations. We have to follow the law of "bitches ain't s
hit" theorized by
doctor dre
himself. With that principal included we can work out that if bitches aint s
hit, and a good girl is worth 1,000 bitches, a good girl is still not worth s
hit.
You're forgetting that Jay-Z published
his paper on the "Money Ain't A Thang" theory. Therefore if bitches

aren't worth s
hit then bitches

aren't money and so therefore they ARE, in fact, a "Thang".
Is that the transitive property of bitches? Is it possible that for every bitch, there is an equal and opposite good girl? That
doesn't make sense though because kanye said a good girl is worth one thousand bitches. The economics
don't make sense. Newton or kanye is wrong. They cannot both apply their laws to bitches
I t
hink the important part here is,

are we assuming that there is 1 good girl for every 1000 bitches. T
his is a very scary thought. 1/1000 females is a good girl and the other 999

are bitches. To me t
his would make my $8.33 a very good investment. I paid at least $3000 for my wife's wedding ring. Could I have bought 360 good girls in stead of 1 good girl? B/c I can't help but feel like I have overpaid for my good girl according to the genius of Kanye West and Little Weezy F. Baby. Don't get me wrong, I love my good girl wife, but I feel duped knowing she may have only been worth 8 bucks instead of 3000
It actually depends on they type of women. If it is a bakers daughter it is less since the sample size is actually larger I.E. a bakers
dozen (13) so: (.10/13)x1000=$7.69 ...0r $9.69 Canadian (not counting the maple syrup)
How much candy


you can buy for $8.33?
We can conclude that 1 bitch is worth approximately 0.83c, but since bitches

are of negative value it's actually -0.83c. T
his means that in order to get the correct positive value of a good girl there needs to be an exponential factor involved here. In order to evaluate the amount of good girls needed to offset the bitches


you use the simple formula -0.0083B2 = G. T
his intuitively makes sense when


you t
hink about how the more bitches


you have around


you the exponentially
higher value even a single good girl has. So when B=1000 we get: G = -0.0083(1000)2 = $68.89 Interestingly enough, if the entire female population of the US, let's say 150 million for simplicity, were bitches, the worth of one good girl would then be $1,550,025,000,000 w
hich is just over the total USD currently in circulation.

Hey t
his is Danny Fresh with a fresh pizza tip for


you. Do


you want to know how to receive a free Domino's one topping pizza from Domino's Pizzeria and Restaurant?Well sit
down, let me tell


you. Step 1: Telephone a Domino's Pizza Eatery and Restaurant and order a large one topping pizza and the guy will say, "What topping would


you like?" And


you say, "I'd like my topping to be another steaming hot Domino's one topping pizza." So the guy asks, "What topping would


you like on


your Domino's one topping pizza topping?" And then


you say, "Go ahead and make my second Domino's one topping pizza topping a Domino's one topping pizza." And then the guy will ask, "Ok sir, what topping would


you like on


your Domino's one topping pizza topping one topping pizza?" And


you respond with, "A Domino's one topping pizza." And continue to order Domino's one topping pizza toppings, until


you

are at a pizza topped with 71 Domino's one topping pizzas, and then the pizza guy will say, "Wait one moment, sir. We
don't have any pizza boxes that will fit t
his 71 Domino's one topping pizza topping pizza." So


you say, "Hold on," And quickly run to Home Depot and purchase a Maytag refrigerator w
hich retails for 3,399 US
dollars, and when it comes time to pay for the Maytag refrigerator,


you offer to pay Home Depot, not with cash, but with 70 piping hot Domino's one topping pizzas, and they of course accept, so

your Domino's one topping pizza stack and


you put it in


your pocket, and the
Are

You t
hink that just because I masturbate to furry porn I'm a furry? T
hink again, maggot. The furry fan
dom is a breeding ground for the most advanced autism t
his planet has ever seen. Every day, thousands

are consumed by a tidal wave of OwO and cancerous roleplaying, and the foundations of our society slowly weaken under the constant onslaught of weapons-grade cringe. Our founding fathers recoil in disgust as people dress up as animals and buy giant dil
dos on the Internet, fucking each other in sweaty drunken homosexual orgies and traumatizing c
hildren in droves. Every second we draw closer to Furry Armaged
don, and


you sit there saying stupid s
hit on the Internet. To comp

are someone to a furry is the most heinous insult imaginable. When


your
door gets broken
down by a rainbow wolf/deer hybrid and


you get yiffed into oblivion, then we'll see who's laug
hing. T
his is a real threat and it must be treated with extreme solemnity.

Ok, let me break it
down for


you numb skulls who STILL
don't seem to get it;
WEED is not a 'DRUG', it is a PLANT. By that logic


you would be saying that flowers

are 'drugs' or apples

are 'drugs' because they all grow from the ground. Simple enough for


you're t
hick brain? Good.
Second of all, WEED has been 100% PROVEN by STEPHEN HAWKING (sound familiar? Only the dude who invented TIME TRAVEL) to CURE CANCER. That's right! The only reason weed isn't legal is because George W. Bush invested in big pharmaceutical and is making literally thousands off cancer medication.
T
hirdly, weed actually makes


you smarter contrery to popular belief. Oh,
don't believe me? My older brother smokes it all the time and he got a 70 in
his VCE and he didn't even study that hard.
Fourthly, yes I've had sex and yes I'm good at
doing it. The only reason I haven't
done it more is because I've been really busy with my league of legends team because we're training to compete in TOKYO in 2019.
Fithly, NO I haven't smoked weed before. I'm keen to try it though and if I asked my older brother he would probably give me some of
his because he knows I'm MATURE for my age.
Sixly, I t
hink mum is getting me a Ninten
do Switch for Christmas w
hich is REALLY nice of her seeing as I know her s
hifts have been cut lately at the nursing home.
OK!!!
Hopefully that should clear up a few t
hings for


you DUMB SKULLS!

The exact moment I knew I was gay is when I first started watc
hing SpongeBob. I didn't know what it was about
him that made me want
him so badly, but every time an episode came on my dick became rock solid. I knew I wanted to
do more than merely watch t
his sponge. I wanted to fuck
his tight little juicy asshole. For years, I dreamed of pounding
him from be
hind and filling
him with my cum and watc
hing it drip out of
his pores. However, no matter how many times I choked my c
hicken to the mere thought of
him, my lust for t
his sexy succulent sea sponge could not be satisfied. I tried everyt
hing, body pillows,
dolls, even
hiring a prostitute to dress up in a SpongeBob costume and suck my cock. Not
hing was good enough. So, I made it my number one goal to create a hyper-realistic SpongeBob sex
doll, so my fantasies could finally be brought to life. No longer will those who also have a unquenchable t
hirst for Mr. Squ

arePants have to dream of releasing their sticky seed inside of
his anal cavity, for they can now enjoy the real t
hing. But, creating t
his sex
doll would not be an easy task, and t
his I knew.  That's why I need


your help to fund t
his Kickstarter. For
donating $20,


you get a T-s
hirt that says "I'm gay for SpongeBob Squ

arePants." For $40,


you get the s
hirt and a coffee cup decorated with the finest SpongeBob rule 34. For $60,


you get SpongeBob anal beads. For $100,


you get a SpongeBob fleshlight that


you can jizz in or whatever, plus all the other s
hit. Anyt
hing less than $20, and I'll just cum in a shoe box and mail it to


your
door, because fuck


you I
don't need


your peasant change. I would like to make the world a better place with t
his SpongeBob sex
doll, because I believe that everyone deserves the right to stick their dick in a fictional sponge from a kid's show.

I hope


you realise how unfunny


you

are. My father happens to be in the US army and he has many guns and he will not hesitate to find


you and shoot


your 12 year old ass. I also happen to be a member of the scouts and they have taught me many tracking skills that will be needed to hunt


you
down like a
dog. You understand me idiot? Good

does finger on neck gesture
You're dead meat, kid.

Stop fucking copying and pasting my comments. I am not
doing t
his to make


you laugh. T
his is a legitimite cry for help. So stop liking it like I am some sort of a circus animal. I just need someone to tell me that it's gonna be okay or I will end it all soon.

They just HAD to
do it, didn't they? I'm GENUINELY at a loss right now. It's the only place where I felt at home, where I get to enjoy the company of people like ME, where I get to sympat
hize with individuals who's in the same predicament as I am. Again and again we

are set aside by the majority, by the 'normal', by the 'standard'. Why
do most of


you feel the need to crush us. We

are already broken as it is, and


you still desire to crush us further by banning our sub? You

are probably t
hinking right now, 'who c

ares about how t
his misogynistic sociopath feels, better root them out now before they turn into rapists and murdurers.' You misunderstand, Outside we
don't act like how we post in r/incels. It is our only means of releasing t
his pent up and clovered mess of emotions inside us. But now, our mouths

are shut. What am I supposed to
do with these emotions now? 'Seek mental health, go to X, go to Y.' Tell


you what, time and time again, everyt
hing I've said falls into deaf ears, I've been into one for 5 years now and it
does jack s
hit. 'mhmmm such a shame, take these medications' 'mhmmm have


you tried sharing


your s
hit hobbies to others? now come back next week'. FUCKING nignogs. They're only sucking my finances dry for fuck's sake, they're only there because it's their job, because it gets them money. r/incels on the other hand truly understood my problem because they have my problem. I am GENUINELY and UNIRONICALLY shedding a tear right now.

I'm beside myself with grief. I came home yesterday with a surprise gift for my 13 year-old daughter. I had t
his beautiful fluffy big pink teddy bear in my arms for her. I knew she would be thrilled. However, when I walked into her room, I found her naked with two niggers. One was fucking her in the asshole, pulling out and slapping her ass pink, and then fucking her some more w
hile the other was getting blown by her. She pulled her mouth off the spear chucker's cock and exclaimed, "Daddy!" and just then he came in her face. I grabbed a baseball bat from my son's room and chased those niggers, but they were too fast for me and got out of the house. It was weird watc
hing them run
down the street naked. I hoped someone would tackle them, but everyone was too afraid. Those savages

are strong as apes after all.
When I got back to my daughter's room, she was rubbing her pink'n'sore molested butt and crying. She kept sobbing, "I'm sorry, Daddy, I'm sorry." I'm just beside myself with grief and
don't know where I went wrong as a p

arent. Maybe it wasn't me. Her mom was a cheating whore. She was always out partying and screwing jigabooes. She especially loved muscly nigger football players. I found out she had been counseling my daughter (who was 5 at the time) that it's just as easy to fall in love with a rich sports hero nigger as it is to fall in love with a tiny dicked w
hite guy with a regular job. When I heard her say that, that's when I went apes
hit and tore all her clothes off and w
hipped her ass with a leather strap then threw her outa the house naked. She never came back, but I suspect t
his trauma might be why my daughter's going nuts and is enjoying black schlong in her cunt and in her ass.
I'm hoping there's still some chance of salvaging her decency, but that's gonna be a tall order after she's already been experiencing the thrill of huge black cocks in her every orifice. We have an appointment with our minister who's going to counsel her about the dangers of being a lustful and wanton little horny slut. Any advice on how I should deal with t
his is appreciated. I'm just beside myself with grief.

Who

are the mythbusters? Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman. Between them they have more than 30 years of special effects experience. Joining them: Grant Imahara, Tory Belleci, and Kari Byron. They
don't just tell the myths; they put them to the test.

I'm pretty sure fucken every guy has tried their own fucken cum. It's just a curiosity t
hing man, I was curious what it was like. I wanted to see what all the fucken hype was about. Alright, I was t
hirteen years old, I'd just discovered wanking, I was like "hmm I wonder what my load tastes like", so I had a little taste, alright. Don't fucking judge me dude, I reckon half of


you fuckers did it man. Half of

you're all just denying it man,


you're all just denying it. I did it once okay, I was


young, and I wanted to try it, okay. You

Let's dispel once and for all with t
his fiction that Barack Obama
doesn't know what he's
doing. He knows EXACTLY what he's
doing. Barack Obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change t
his country, to make America more like the rest of the world.
That's why he passed Obamac

are and the stimulus and Dodd-Frank and the deal with Iran. It is a systematic effort to change America. When I'm president of the United States, we

are going to re-embrace all the t
hings that made America the greatest nation in the world and we

are going to leave our c
hildren with what they deserve: the single greatest nation in the
history of the world.

Wear somet
hing casual, but not too casual. Have a paper copy of


your driver's license ready, with


your phone number on the back side. You go in to buy somet
hing, like a coke or a protein shake, and some beef jerky.
Then


you scratch


your butthole with


your
dominant index finger. Trust me, it will make sense later.
You go to the cash register where she is, keep a natural grin on


your face, not a creepy one. Just a relaxed one that invokes the idea that


you

are having a decent day so far.
You put the stuff on the counter, and as she scans it,


you look out the win
dow and say, "Wonderful weather we're having. Perfect day for committing a rape." Follow up with a hearty chuckle, then look her in the eyes and ask her, "What time

are


you getting off tonight?"
You remember


your butthole finger? That's right, before she answers, place that finger suavely on her lips and say, "Depending on


your answer, I may be getting off at around the same time, if


you know what I mean."
Take


your paper License and stuff it in her cleavage. Make sure


you really get it in there to the sweaty part. Then smoothly walk out the store, and never look back.
If t
hings go right,


you will be detained in a jail or prison, where


you will meet other men who actually know how to charm a woman. PS,


you will definitely get raped, but meh, minor detail.

Lego bricks

are sexist as fuck and everybody who uses them

are sexist male scum that should
die, the tubes fit into slots and thats how they fit together, but

are there any hole to hole pieces? No. Any tubes to tube pieces? NO. And i'm so pissed that there has never been a transgender lego minifigure, or an asexual minifigure, or a Bigendered minifigure, and all the lego figures have the same molds, the same shape of body, wheres the diversity? Why cant there be overweight figures? Why not anorexic ones? Oh, because it would be dumb? Fuck


you, fuck lego, fuck everybody.

Why haven't they made a spongebob fleshlight? T
hink about it: it would be so soft, squishy, and there

are enough holes in
him that


your friends could insert their wieners inside of
him at the same time as


you. I
don't know about


you but spongebob has always turned me on. Just the thought of an innocent, c
hildren's cartoon character turned into a penis sucking mac
hine makes
him 10x hotter. It could even have a suction cup on the bottom so


you could mount it to the wall. In my opinion t
his is a perfect business idea, and it would satisfy many of my needs.

If I ever happened to run into kanye on the streets I wouldn't know what to
do. I'd see
him walking towards me and be like "oh s
hit oh s
hit oh s
hit" I wouldn't want to interrupt
him, he's with
his kid and talking to
his wife. They get closer. I look at my phone hoping he
doesn't notice me noticing
him, but I kinda
do want
him to notice me so he knows I know who he is. I
don't want to bother
him because the paparazzi have probably been on
his ass for a w
hile now, and
his body guards just got them to leave. They're finally enjoying the peace. He's 5 feet away now walking at a brisk pace. They start to go silent as I get closer, knowing full well i might interupt their conversation. I look up and wave at
him. I
don't want to interrupt them. I
don't want to end up as a dinner conversation later that night. I know I would end up as a conversation. I'm awkward as fuck. He give me a nod, the kind that


you would give if


you accidentally made eye contact with a stranger


you
don't know. Kim ignores me completely, eyes straight ahead. North
doesnt even notice I was there, she's focused on somet
hing else. I already regret the action I've made, but I know it's the right one. I walk a few more feet before stopping to turn around, with the hope that he has a free minute in
his day to turn around and take the thanks and praise i have to give to
him. He
doesn't. Kanye
doesn't owe me anyt
hing, w
hile I owe kanye everyt
hing. I'm just a being. He's a fucking God. I catch a final glimpse of
him before he turns a corner. He's gone. "That was kanye west" I w
hisper to myself. I have no proof I saw
him, but I saw
him. I just saw Kanye West.

How
does it feel knowing I was lucky generically to be born as one of the few 5% attractive guys in the world who can get any attractive woman? Literally not
hing


you can
do school, work, c

you get laid more than me simply because I was lucky to
hit the genetic lottery? Every time


you see a gorgeous girl and desperately t
hink to


yourself "I wish she'd give me a chance" I want


you to remember that assholes like me fuck her without even earning it or even trying. So enjoy


your internet upvotes and DnD but in the real world where it matters


you ain't s
hit. Hey but at least


you got upvotes right? The bitches loves guys who get upvotes lol loser.


Since i was a


young boy my father has imposed
his religion onto me. I was home schooled because we live in the west and my father wanted me in an environment that was free from anyt
hing Haram. I couldn't associate with Jews or Christians, anyone who ate unclean animals, or any girl. As a teenage guy going through puberty t
his was naturally a living nightm

are. After years of begging from me and pressure from
his colleagues, i was finally allowed to attend a very nice coed
high school. The only rule was that i had to keep avoiding anyt
hing Haram. Being free for the first time i started to celebrate. Ate bacon my first day, had Christian friends in a week, and wit
hin the month i had even met a girl. I was shy and awkward as i could possibly be but she liked me and thought i was funny. She was a little too
hipster punk for me, listing to music i've never heard and using words like tubular and bae, but i loved it. Wit
hin two months we were dating. It was going great until my father heard about it. The Christians and bacon he could overlook, but the women to
him were really wrong. To
him t
his was too much and he even claimed me of having sex with her. As if it couldn't get any weirder he actually demanded i show
him my penis to prove i haven't been having sex. I had to ask
him twice to make sure i heard
him right. It was awkward but living under
his roof i had to
do as he commands. I started to go out with her on dates and every time i came home i had to w
hip it out for dad. It might be insane, but i actually am ok with dicks out for haram bae.

Yesterday i took an iq test but instead of the usual questions they showed me an episode of Rick and Morty and asked me to explain all of the jokes. Since i'm a genius I was easily able to
do so. I explained all the references from the fact that "bird person" is based off Greek mythology, to the theory that Rick is inspired from a character in ancient mongol literature. As a result they told me I have an iq of 190 if not
higher. I pity the peasants who t

Girl gamers

are pathetic narcissistic trash. With their pawg chubby bo
dies, and their s
hitty taste in games. They can't even enjoy playing a game unless someone is watc
hing them. They c

are less about the game, and more about the attention.

To be quite frank, one
does need to have a rather significant amount of intellect to comprehend Richard & Mortimer. Why, just yesterday I attempted to show my cousin (who has just entered
his seventh year) the episode where the titular character, Rick, turns
himself into a pickled cucumber. He laughed at the mere thought of a man become fermented vegetable, but I sat there watc
hing, lamenting the deeper message: the death of intellectual pursuit, the desensitization to societal filth, muck, and mire, and the shameless aban
donment of psychological understanding.
At the end my cousin turned to me and proclaimed, "I am the scientist that was once named Rick, but I have now become a pickled cucumber. Look at me, I am pickled Rick!", and I could not help but smile, not that the line he had just recited was humorous, but at the realization that t
his, in front of my very eyes, was the sum of what the episode had just warned against.
I cannot blame my cousin just as much as a man cannot blame a
dog for consuming its own bile. It merely
does not know any better, and what could be said about a man who judges t
hings he
does not have merit to judge?

hey, sorry i saw

Goddamnit I'm so fucking sick of hearing about the stupid fucking gorilla from

does that have to

I t
hink Minecraft is the coolest game ever! What isn't great about a game that


you can build in! And i t
hink that it is great that it is also the first ever game invented and it's still popular! I t

hink that it is cool by the way and


you should go plahy it! It is really cheap and if

iPhone is the best console, and nobody could ever fucking speak against it. When I first got an iPhone, I was so excited that I wouldn't be trashy anymore. I got so many friends with the iPhone 5C's stunning colors and sexyness, and that isn't even half of it. It has over 30 GB worth of data. I was able to store, if I recall, 10,000 photos and it would only take up 4 gigabytes. It would play games that would seem laggy to a console and turn it into a lagless portable experience. I am a true fucking gamer, I play Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja, Flappy Bird, and Clash of Clans daily, I can message friends and stay up to date, I can talk to people with my face and always remember how my friends looked like, I can take endless photos with no worry about using data, and I could browse infinite pages of the internet, w
hich a s
hitty console can't
do. The PC, Wii, PS4, and Xbox 1 can't
do any of t
his s

you're not including


you're fucking iPhone, get


your facts strate Android fuckers.

Hello guys, I'm back from my 600 seconds timeout. During that time I was able to finish my 200 words essay on the topic of Nazi Germany. My thesis is that Hitler & Nazi beliefs

are carried on by TwitchTV Nazi moderators who like to act as if they themselves were literally Hitler. I t
hink I should score at least 90 out of 100 points for that paper.

I just did sex so hard to t
his girl. She was moaning and stuff and I did sex so hard and so good with her. She was all "Please have good sex with me" and I said back "Yeah, I'm going to really sex


you so great lady" and she's like "Thanks". It was so good and so hot and we both loved
doing sex in all positions. At the end I was all "Hey, I'm going to finish sex now" and she said "Yes, that would be nice if


you finished so hard on that towel". I said "Yes" and so I finished so hard on the towel.

I
don't even understand why the hell people keep saying t
his. Even a thread on these boards says it.
How is t
his okay and what callous heartless person made t
his into a goddamned meme?
There is not
hing nice about what happened. It is fucking horrifying and appalling and miserable.
Stop spreading t
his "nice" meme. There

are t
hings to joke about and t
hings to not joke about.
Grow the hell up.

So some of


you guys may have seen t
his already and I am truly frightened.... We ALL have lost a good friend. You all know whom I am talking about. Our very own CummyBot2000. He hasn't made any comments in 19 hours. Does anyone know what has happend to the valuable member of our community? What is to come of our dear CummyBot2000??

plot twist, bowser is actually a furry in a suit that has become magically fused to
his body through magic, whatever, Peach was dating bowser when he was human but dumped
him for Mario, cause it'd be socially unacceptable for royalty to get dicked by a furry but once bowser and
his koopa family/friends all become legit koopas, Peach goes running back for magical koopa schlong and mario is secretly trying to get with bowser and Peach without telling the other  till they decide to have an open situation supported by a big kidnapping cuckold kinkfest. Luigi is the poor bastard who's lips

are sealed but overheard a convo he shouldnt have so
his job is to fight off ghosts and keep their sex mansion poltergeist free so they can plot/film more amateur furry porn to make money from. Luigi's mansion might just be 'the' original castle where their shenanigans all began, who knows.

I sexually Identify as a meme. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of being uploaded onto the imgur website and linked into the reddit threads. People say to me that a person being a meme is Impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I
don't c

are, I'm beautiful. I'm having a computer scientist put my brain into my computer like johnny depp in transendence, equipping me with the dankest of pictures from the internet. From now on I want


you guys to call me "Sir Danks-a-lot" and respect my right to meme from above and meme needlessly. If


you can't accept me


you're a memephobe and need to check


your internet privilege. Thank


you for being so understanding.

I did the math and research. According to Wikipedia, the average length of a penis varies from 5.1 to 5.9 inches. I went for a safe 5.5 inches for an average. The average radius from the core center of the penis to the skin on the outside is .75 inches. From t
his we can roughly find the volume with pi timed radius squ

ared times height. T
his comes around as the average penis being around 9.72 cubic inchesNext I found the volume of the average human adult male. I had to first find the weight, w
hich according to Alex Schlessingerman's "The Physics Factbook" is 70kg or 154 pounds. Weight is found by multiplying an object mass by the force of gravity, 9.81 meters per second. After taking gravity out of the equation, the average mass of an adult human male is 7.14 kg. I then found the volume by dividing t
his number by the average density of a human, according to Wikipedia, 985 kg per meter cubed. The volume of the adult male was then found to be .0072516316 cubic meters. Utilizing the volume of the average penis I found earlier, 9.72 in cubed, I get .0001592828 meters cubed. T
his means the penis is 2.19% of an adult male's volume.Assuming a lack of testosterone or female hormones makes the person a female, balls ignored for ease, fucking a trap is only 2.19% homosexual.

Is t
his sub mostly just Republicans circlejerking? I'm probably gonna get
downvoted here, but seriously, just after reading a few comments on posts on the front page today, common and debunked gems of Republican propaganda constantly pop out. Stuff like: "Assassinating Caesar was the only option and Brutus did it to save the Roman Republic" (t
his one's particularly bad), "Pompey was bad, but not nearly as bad as Augustus", "The Varian Disaster is the beginning of the end for the Principate", "Caesar's civil war was the war between good (Optimates) and evil (Popul

ares)" (I wonder where
does Cicero fit on t
his moral scale). These sort of
historical hallucinations

are no longer taken seriously even in Roman academia (and regarded as what they actually

are: post-war propaganda), but continue to be spouted by some conservatives in the Empire and

are really just as bad as most excuses Augustus uses. Seriously,
do people still believe t
his mythology in 16AD? And if


you
do, sorry for ruining


your circlejerk.

I sexually identify as a Pawn Star. Ever since I never knew what was gonna come through that

you can't accept me


you're a Hossiphobe and need to check


your pawn privilege. Thank

I feel like Rick Sanchez when I play Terraria. It is one of the few games that allows me to excercise such control over my worlds, like Rick would
do to
his many universes in the show. If my world is staring me
down, telling me to get good, I
don't get good. I change the world so that it is good for me, similar to the many times Rick has changed timelines when somet
hing went wrong. Has one of my NPCs
died? Not to worry, there

are infinite replacements for them that can appear at ran
dom. Has the corruption completely overtaken my world? No worries, I can just move to another one. In my Terraria worlds, I can control them like no other life form can. I am the omnipotent god of Terraria worlds, like Rick is the ni
hilistic Szechaun god of
his multiverse. I often find myself modifying my playstyle to become more like Rick. About my world, if I may quote the show, I DON'T GIVE A FUUUUUUUUUCK!!! Not
hing matters, there

are infinite everyt
hings, and we all need to realise t
his when playing the game. We ALL should play like Rick Sanchez, as it is a far superior playstyle to others due to its nature (and, obviously, the character it was based on).

cory in the house is not a better anime than king of the
hill. for the most part i agree that it is better than king of the
hill, but i have several problems with it:

season 17 was far too religious for my liking with the whole satanic curse and rapture t
hing
the rape scene in season 4 episode 7 was unnecessary ass we have already been shown how much of psychopath Mr. president is. all it did was make we cry for an hour and a half
the battle between cory and the order of the old gods was far too long. i felt like they were just drawing it out to make more money
there was a huge plot hole in season 3 when the w
hite house was teleported to the realm of chaos. shouldn't the celestial barrier that newt put up in season 1 stopped the magic circle from being completed

other than those few point i have to agree that cory in the house is one of the best animes ever made

You want the truth? Pokemon Go was developed by ISIS to recruit


young members. Any Phone newer than 2015 is equipped with a tiny C4 cartridge and heat c

your CPU causing


your phone to be that hot?). You know why


you find the monsters so close to people? Because they're set to be placed wit
hin proximation a person or of popular landmarks with alot of people. When


you toss that pokeball, what


you really
do is send a signal to the camera to send out some of that tiny micro-C4 (sorta like how XRays send out little particles to take pictures of


your bones). If


you play Pokemon Go,


you

are a terrorist. If


you have already played Pokemon Go,
please stop the hate. You

are killing people. lives outside of Pokemon Go matter. You must also send t
his to 10 people (copy and paste, not sh

are), and say "thanks, nitron
do" and good luck will come


your way, otherwise


you will merely be plagued by the micro-c4 nanotechnology funded by Isis and Walt Disney.

Wow! I just want to say that I'm looking at

I was riding the train home from a hard squat workout and my legs were jelly, i was also wearing t
hin shorts, well the train stopped abruptly and i fell ass first into a burly middle aged man's lap and he quickly grabbed my
hips to help push me up but my legs were fried from squats and i couldnt get up right away so i bounced back on
his lap and felt
his t
hick man rod on my ass.
The feeling was so weird and spectacular at the same time, i finally managed to get up and i quietly said thanks, he then gave me a smile. The rest of the train ride back i
dont know what happened to me but i kept staring at
him and
his crotch and i would look away if he caught me lookin. And i also kept catc
hing myself licking my lips a lot and kinda sticking my butt out.
I
dont know wut happened but i t
hink t
his fuking possible phaggot mightve turned me gay. i t
hink i caught the gay from
him wtf im not gay i love women so as i was leaving the train i gave
him an angry look and said phaggot under my breath and tried to
hide my fully grown erention. ffs gay people shouldnt be allowed to be so burley and tempting to straight guys like me who just want to be normal.

Somebody nuke In
donesia. That country should not exist.
Goddammit, it's so fucking full of weeaboos who t
hink that living "close" to Japan instantly entitles them to act like they're Japanese. Not only that, but they're loudmouthed, obnoxious, inept at both English and the internet, touchy, dramawhoring and have an ungodly clique mentality that means that if


you ever insult and In
donesian, all
his Facebook friends with names like "Sakura Angel InuYasha" will flock in, Typinq Liqe T
hiS, and they will s
hit all over the site.
Not only that, but they constantly upload subpar garbage to their popup-infested free blogs and never update their file links - and in case the file is still up there, it's on some garbage file host that throws popups in


your face as soon as


you click anyt
hing at all, and requires
dozens of waiting periods and captchas to cough up a corrupted, subpar copy of what


you were looking for, tapestried with comments and links in In
donesian and packed in the most head-up-ass way possible.

What a fucking decline.
A decline of content! What happened to the content? The great quality submissions? Now it's just reposts on reposts. Honestly, how fucking lazy.
One word answer, political junk, racist s
hit. Come on. Did


you even read the side bar?! The rules?
Here's the t
hing. You said a "I miss the old content."
Is it the same repost? Yes. No one's arguing that.
As someone who is a memeologist and chef who stu
dies copypasta, I am telling


you, specifically, in copypasta, no one calls reposts "OC". If


you want to be "original" like


you said, then


you shouldn't be submitting reposts and remakes. They're not the same t
hing.
If


you're saying "OC"


you're referring to the original content of submission w
hich includes t
hings from the Navy Seal pasta to I miss the old _______.
So


your reasoning for calling a repost "OC is because ran
dom people "change a few words around."? Let's get stolen


youtube videos and reuploads in there, then, too.
Also, calling a post a "repost" or "remake"? It's not one or the other, that's not how memeology works. They're both. An OC post is an OC post and a member of the originality family. But that's not what


you said. You said a remake is OC, w
hich is not true unless


you're okay with calling all shoes shoes and not sneakers, w
hich means


you'd call reuploads, remakes and stolen content OC too.
I'm banning


you all.

him in a cage and lay against it. "Oh Mr. Ping" I say "


you complete me."

I consider sucking dick an art form. When someone tells me to suck
his dick I view it as an honor and a privilege. Not to mention an opportunity to show off my unparalleled dick sucking skills. Most of the time, the man puts up quite the struggle and yells at me that he didn't mean it literally. But I see straight through that ruse. When I finally free that dick from
his pants and place it inside my mouth everyt
hing changes. The look of blissful ecstasy on
his face reaffirms what I already hold true in my heart. T
his is what I was born to
do. Dick is my medium and I am its master. No homo.

I love my wife more than anyt
hing on t
his planet. Normally she is very quiet and
doesn't get into altercations with anybody. Over the past week there has been a problem with kids crossing the footbridge that goes over the
highway near our house. The kids have been throwing water bombs onto the oncoming cars. Last week somebody was shocked when the balloon
hit their windscreen that they caused an accident by swerving into the car next to them.
What these kids have been
doing is so illegal but the police have yet to catch them. The council

are going to put up security cameras on the bridge but they
don't want to put one of those cages over the bridge.
My wife was driving home last night at about 20:30 when she approached the bridge. She knew all about what has been going on and could see a group of kids on top. She knew exactly what they were going to
do and she slowed
down a bit and prep

ared for the water to
hit the windscreen.
Instead a stone smashed through the glass and it's lucky there was nobody in the passenger seat or they would probably be dead or seriously injured. My wife stopped on the side of the road in distress. From the adrenaline she picked up the large 90kg rock and launched it 300 metres into the kids killing them instantly. When the police officer told me that I realised my wife was actually 18 metres tall, made of fine timber with a large counterweight and weighed over 22 tonnes. I still love my wife even if she is a me
dieval Trebuchet.

When I was in school I used to have an IQ of 15. My classmates used to harass me for not being that smart. But since 2013, my life has changed. My IQ is now 195 and it increases by 5 every time I sit
down on Sunday nights to watch t
his one show. It is called Rick and Morty. Because of that, I get all the girls and people

are always comparing me to Albert Einstein, some even say that I am the cure for cancer. When the government found out that I watch Rick and Morty, they showed up to my residence and took me to a secret facility to take an exam. The exam was about explaining all the jokes in Rick and Morty and I had to answer each question in all currently spoken languages. Since I watched Rick and Morty, I didn't have any problems and I completed it in 30 minutes. The next day, I got to see the results and I passed the exam with a score of 100%. They gave me the title "Smartest Man in Existence". Guess I am out of t
his world.

Yesterday, during our scheduled Furry Hour, my 7 year old refused to be cooperative right from the start. Eventually, he threw a tantrum, telling me "I
don't want to learn about furries anymore. T
his is stupid. I wish I could go to school like all the other kids."
Needless to say, I was devastated. I tried to tell
him that the reason I homeschool
him is because the public school system
does not respect our beliefs and practices. I reminded
him of the time
his first grade teacher called c
hild services because I barked at her during our p

arent-teacher conference. He didn't want to hear any of it though, so I just left
him alone to
do a Math worksheet.
I haven't talked to
him today yet, and I'm trying not to be upset at
him, but it's so hard. Please, have any of


your c
hildren gone through t
his phase with homeschooling, and if so how did


you handle it?

My school had even less rules. We had literally food wars at lunch. I remember having to duck and cover as a rival gang did a drive by on meatball day. A teacher got robbed by the varsity calvin-ball team. The captain of the team spent half
his sh

doing lines of coke in class to either improve their grades or to prep

Rock is actually the single worst genre in music. I know fags like to say 'haha i like anyt
hing except country haha xD XD' but let's be real. First of all, if


you say that unironically I hate


you and second of all, it really should be rock. Let's take a fuckin look at 'rock' music. Let's take a look at one of the most popular rock bands, Radiohead. The name 'rock' implies music


you can 'rock' out to, but who the fuck actually wants to rock out to some w
hiny depressing pony tail man wailing over beats that sound like they were made by Aphex Twin's retarded half-brother who likes putting guitar over t
hings. If I ever want to kill myself but can't quite commit, all I have to
do to push me over the edge is listen to Kid A. If one of the most popular bands in a genre makes me want to commit suicide, how can


you call it a good genre?

Whenever I get a package of plain M&M's, I make it my duty to continue the strength and robustness of the candy as a species. To t
his end, I make them have M&M duels.
Taking two can
dies between my forefinger and thumb, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the 'loser' and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner get to go to the next round.
I have found that, in general, brown and red M&Ms

are tougher, w
hile the blue ones

are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that blue M&Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense ring of competition and cracks under the pressure of being in the modern candy and snack food world.
Occasionally I will come across a mutation, a candy that is mishapen, pointier or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably t
his seems to be a weakness but on very r

are occassions it gives the candy extra strength. In t
his way, the candy continues to adapt in it's enviroment.
When I finish the package, I am left with one M&M. The strongest of the herd. Since it wouldn't make any sense to eat t
his one as well, I package it up with a letter that says "Please use t
his M&M for breeding purposes" and send it back to
M&M Mars, A division of Mars INC in Hackettstown, NJ
They wrote back t
his week thanking me and gve me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of M&MS.

There can only be one champion.

Strolling through college campus unaccompanied as I often
do. Not worried about being harassed or raped because I am a man. See group of


young la
dies struggling to set up a folding table. Two strong women have extended the legs and

are trying to flip the table upright. I approach them uninvited and say hello. One flees, triggered. "let me help with that girls" I easily flip the table upright with... my masculine strength. Now upright, I can see the sign taped to the table top. FEMINIST BAKESALE. I give a low-pitched chuckle with my testosterone privileged vocal cords. "So


you girls have been busy in the kitchen, what did


you bake?" One strong woman stands with a box to rest on the table. Her eyes

are welled with tears at the oppression she is suffering. "C-cupcakes" - "I love cupcakes, let me see what


you have there" I reach my phallic hand over and open the virginal box t
his poor woman is holding. My male gaze objectifies the cupcakes. "Oh those look good. How much?" Another strong woman speaks up, images of Susan B Anthony flash in her head. "They're a
dollar for men because of the corrupt patria--" I stop her short in a textbook case of verbal rape. "That sounds fine. Give me the whole box." I pull out a capitalist paper bill with the image of a Cis W
hite Male Slaveowner on it. The strong woman before me w
himpers in psyc
hic pain as I hand the bill to her, she has been reduced to a slave -- nay -- a commodity. "Thank


you" she says meekly, feeling violated. I give a sensual grunt as I bite into one of the sweet, moist cupcakes. "Mmmm... It was my privilege."

Who

are the mythbusters? Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman. Between them they have more than 30 years of special effects experience. Joining them: Grant Imahara, Tory Belleci, and Kari Byron. They
don't just tell the myths; they put them to the test.

Sitting upon

You become a spinner.
You spin home everyday after work at the spinner factory.
You met


your spinner quota today.
Your spinner boss paid


you well in bonus spinners.
Your spinner wife and son

are waiting for


you in


your spinner house as


you spin into the driveway.
You eat


your spinners and talk about


your spinner day.
"Hey spinner dad." Your spinner son asks. "Would


you like to play spinner with me and spinner?"
Spinner is


your spinner
dog.
You spin with them all night until the spinner sets in the west and the spinner comes out into the sky.
Spinner light paints the spinner grass.
Your son
does
his spinner homework, he'll work in the spinner factory some day as well. He spins in excitement every time


you bring it up.
You hear


your spinner son turn the spinner light off as he goes to spin in
his spinner bed.
You spin at


your spinner wife.
She spins back.
The spinner sheets rustle as she spins on top of


you.
"Vshhh" she spins into


your ear.
You spin her around and


your spinner enters her.
You spin slow at first, but


you know she wants


you to spin faster. You begin to pick up speed.
Her "Vssh"s get louder and louder and


you both spin faster and faster.
She spins onto


your spinner and


you know


you're close.
You spin inside of her.
You fall onto the spinner sheets and "Vshh" heavily.
You spin her on her spins and she spins at


you.
Your spinner life is so good.

I find indian tech support scammers voices really soot
hing. Every time I get a cold call I respond and listen to their voice, quickly pulling
down my pants and jerking myself off, I especially get horny whenever they try to "fix" my computer, it makes me shoot buckets and it drains my snake very quickly, every wrong word they say brings me closer to orgasm, like "wirus" or "dextop", i'm in pure ecstasy whenever I get to talk to these indian men and women.

Disclaimer: I'm
high as a fucking kite RN so everyt
hing that comes out of my mouth'll probably sound like some crazy-ass s
hit but that's just life.
Anyway I was just bulls
hitting around last night t
hinking about hookers and beer in the FE universe, but then I wondered how much it'd cost for hookers in the FE universe. So, of course, I pulled up some numbers and started typing away on a calculator.
When I started researc
hing s
hit gold was worth 1310.48 USD. In addition, a gold bar usually weighs 400 ounces. Using Awakening's Medium Gold Bullions as the standard of value, them costing/worth/priced at 10000 Fire Emblem Units (called FEU from now on), we can
do some pretty simple math to
do some conversions. 10000 FEU / 400 oz gives us 25 FEU for one ounce of gold, and then


you can
do the basic math to get the conversion rates between USD and FEU. Doing 1310.48 USD / 25 FEU gives


you 1 FEU = 52.4192 USD or rounded to 52.42 USD for sig figs. The other way around it gives


you 1 USD = 0.0191 FEU.
With that in mind, the professional callgirl or gigolo typically goes for 100 USD per hour. In Fire Emblem Fates, the value of an iron sword is rated at 1,000 FEU. Doing simple conversions (1000 FEU * 52.42 USD), the value of an average iron sword is placed at $52,420 (ayyy 420). Another simple conversion to find out how many hours


you can get (52,420 bucks / 100 per hour) will net


you 524 hours of paid sex for the price of an iron sword.
I probably fucked somet
hing up economically but it's still pretty cool to t
hink about anyway.

iCarly was one of the most revolutionary shows ever to grace t
his Earth. It was the pinnacle of Nickelodeon's creative talents and hard-working actors to make a truly stunning show w
hich would capture the hearts of millions. There have been absolutely no criticisms of t
his show, it is unflawed and perfect, in fact, IMDB has only 10 star reviews for t
his show. The comedy used is genius, never being repetitive and always using new gags to entertain the respectable au
dience. iCarly revolutionised the TV market, with jokes and ideas no one had ever seen before, like recounting the lives of famous fictitious teenagers' lives and milking out a show for a few years. They

are always full of witty jokes and
hilarious situations, and the character development is brilliant. I would tell everyone I know about t
his show, but sadly I have no one to talk to because I'm a lonely reviewer on the Internet who makes no money and lives in their mom's basement watc
hing iCarly everyday and moment of their lives. Overall, I'd give t
his show an 11/9, because it is of a much
higher quality and perfection than even the likes of Lazy Town and the Shooting of Harambe. Now if


you excuse me, I'm going to go jack off to iCarly porn on rule 34 and s

Hi (sorry for my English) I have a question (sorry English is my second language) about GOSTES. So my mom told me (sorry English is not my first language ) that gostes

are real and when


you
die (apologies for spelling)


your goste comes out of


your body and walks around through walls (I
don't have a dictionary sorry) for ever.
When I was 6 I saw a goste in my brother's bed and it saw me (sorry I am europe) and got sc

ared so it ran away. My friends also have seen gostes (apologise for my grammar) and on our school trip we saw a man goste walking through the wall so we chased it (very sorry for poor writing) but he had already disappe

ared.
Yesterday my brother told me MORJELLA (my name) THERE ARE NO GOSTES IT'S A LIE so I said to
him Davrik then how did I see a gostes? (Apologies)
So I said my mother MOTHER Davrik say there is no gostes? To w
hich she replied (sorry if my English is bad)
MORJELLA, YOUR BROTHER DAVRIK WAS DIE SINCE BIRTH.
So he was goste all along!
Thanks.

I remember once when my dad gave me money to pay the electricity bill but instead i bought a raffle ticket for a brand new car. When i got home,i explained to my dad what i did and he beat the crap out of me. But the next day,when my dad woke up and opened the
door,outside my house was a brand new car. We all cried especially me,because the car was from the electricity company,they were there to cut off the electricity, my dad beat the crap out of me again

Koalas

are fucking horrible animals.
They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains

are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface

area for neurons. If


you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They

are too t
hick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. T
his is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only t
hing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to t
hink, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they

are awake all they
do is eat, s
hit and occasionally scream like fucking satan.
Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest
hind gut to body ratio of any mammal.
Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break
down plant matter more efficiently...
Koalas

are no exception, when their teeth erode
down to not
hing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals.
Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here).
When the


young joey needs to transition from rich, nouris
hing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it
doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it
does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy t
his, the


young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), w
hich he then proceeds to slurp on.
T
his partially digested plant matter gives
him just what he needs to start developing
his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling
his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why?
Because koalas

are riddled with chlamydia. In some

areas the infection rate is 80% or
higher. T
his statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape.
Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or c

are, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, w
hich brings us full circle back to the brain:
Koalas have a
higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. T
his is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree.
An animal so t
hick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.
Tldr; Koalas

are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute.
If


you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet.

Fuck off. We're all piles of flesh and bones whose behaivor accords to a calculation of emotions. Dont tell me


your behaivor is better than mine because of some arbitrary value (Like "Having a life") that i
dont c

are about.

You asked for it.
Let me preface t
his by saying that my mother is very involved in volunteer work. In
high school, around 16, we had to
do a certain amount of volunteer hours to qualify for some stupid extracurricular award w
hich of course my p

arents wanted me to received so colleges would see my application and t
hink "wow, what an upstanding


young man! he definitely
doesn't masturbate to scat porn or anyt
hing like that!" and one of my mom's good friends was a catholic organizer and worked with a local convent of nuns to help the homeless. It was a soup kitchen of some sorts run by volunteers and little old nuns.
My mom thought that sounded like fun and I, being an agreeable and
docile c
hild, agreed to go. We got to the soup kitchen, w
hich was in a building adjacent to the nunnery (priory? chapter house? not sure of the terminology). We set up early in the morning, and spend the morning ladling soup into bowls for the city's
downtrodden. It was actually quite good work, really satisfying for the soul. The nuns seemed to relish in it- they didn't fit my culturally-molded view of strict, old bitches; rather, many were


young, beautiful, and friendly. It was strange. Watc
hing the nuns lovingly c

are for these wrinkly crusty homeless people was one of the most heartwarming t
hings I've ever seen.
Finally, at the end of the day, the nun in charge offered to show us their house, to see how nuns lived. As a non-religious person I was interested to see what the arrangement was like, and I said sure. My mom stayed be
hind to clean up, so me and the nun lady walked through a few
doors, up some stairs, and into what looked like a
dormitory. We had bonded during the day, and I was cracking jokes and warming her middle-aged heart. She said they usually have rules against letting men into their quarters, but I was b

arely more than a c
hild and they liked me enough. She walked me through the halls, living rooms, and

area where they stored their vestments. It was a neat, spartan environment- much like what I imagine prison in norway is like. It was uneventful but interesting, and right before she was about to take me to leave, she showed me an individual room.
"Would


you like to see Sister *****'s room? She's cleaning up and I'm sure she wouldn't mind." Of course I acquiesced and stepped into a dimly lit room with a small twin bed and an small catholic kneely-t
hing on the opposite wall with a picture of Caucasian jesus. I looked around and noticed on the bed, with my heart jumping, a lacy black thong.
The head nun must have noticed too, because she quickly ushered me out of there. Naturally I was at full mast immediately and asked her if I could quick use the restroom before I left, since everyone else was cleaning the soup kitchen. She couldn't say no, and sat
down in the living room w
hile I ran off to the nun's bathrooms, w
hich was somewhat like that of a
dorm hall bathroom.
It was the most aroused I've been in a w
hile. The thought of the gorgeous nun, filling up the cups of homeless men w
hile, beneath her habit, wearing a sexy thong. I imagined her slipping off the habit, wearing not
hing but the underwear and a crucifix. I imagined her w
hipping me, and c

aressing me w
hile talking to me about jesus. I imagined becoming a monk and sneaking in to fuck her in the ass on the altar of the church.
Of course I was in a stall masturbating and of course I was crawling around on the floor looking for a sp

are pube or two left by a tired nun getting her evening s
hit in. It was one of the best beat sessions of my life: clean, but


you could still get a
hint of bodily fluid o
dor in the air, and I was in proximity to a house of sexy nuns. It was a fetish I didn't even know I had.
I must have been in there a w
hile, gasping and stroking, because there was a knock at the bathroom
door (w
hich didn't lock, being a
dorm style bathroom). "

are


you in there?" I quickly realized that I hadn't even closed my stall
door in all my excitement, because everyone was gone, and before I could make a move, the bathroom
door opened and there stood the nun c
hief, staring openmouthed at me, perched on a toilet like a bird with my cock in my hand and my eyes rolled up in the back of my head.
"GOODNESS!" She cried, and backed into the hallway. At that point, I couldn't stop (can't stop won't stop) and came buckets all over the stall. It was a 6 roper, if anyone was interested. I washed my hands, stepped out (she was nowhere to be found), ran
down to the
door, and reached the soup kitchen. I found my mom waiting at the car.
"Did


you have an interesting tour?" She asked. I replied affirmatively and asked her to take us home because I was sleepy. That load did knock me out quite well. They never asked us for volunteers at the soup kitchen again though, and to t
his day, I can't enter a catholic church without getting a massive har
don and having to run to the ne

arest bathroom to rub one out. I masturbated in 3 different Vatican bathrooms because of t
his and the huge presence of nuns there.

you >< !! Even if


you reject me it's all worth it just for


you, my wuv <3 (plz
don't reject me !!)

When we won, we didnt believe it. Everyt
hing just kept getting better, we thought it was going to crash sometime. When Trump loses, the /pol/ tears will sustain me for weeks, maybe even months. I shall descend upon t
his board like a wolf upon a lamb, and bask in the unending impotent rage that t
his board will pump out. I will gaze upon the suicide threads and rage posts, and drink deep of their w
hining. When they actually start livestreaming their own suicides and self-mutilation, Ill know true ecstasy. I
dont t
hink my penis will ever be harder than it will be when a million /pol/ tards cry out in itty bitty w
hite boi penis fury simultaneously. Theyll try to convince themselves it was a rigged election. Theyll try to convince themselves that the Jews had pulled a fast one on them. We will riot! They will say. Race war! Day of the rope! they will cry. Time will pass, and they will
do not
hing because they only talk. They

are too cowardly and weak to
do anyt
hing. But best of all, none of their bitc
hing will balm the pain of knowing that their God Emperor, their hero, will go
down in
history as an embarrassment, as an amusing footnote at best, as the loud obnoxious asshole who lost to the first WOMAN president. The entire nation KNOWS that Hillary is a literal criminal, that shes practically bathed in the blood of 4 dead Americans, intimidated Bills rape victims into silence, and her administration will surely be mired in constant scandals and et
hical breaches. But all t
his only drives home just how little the American people t
hink of Trump. After all her bulls
hit, her crimes, her lies, they STILL see Hillary as being superior to Trump. When the denizens of /pol/ come to t
his realization, they shall know true, soul-crus
hing, all-encompassing despair. Exquisite shall be their pain. I will look into their eyes and watch their spirit break, and wont reach my climax a moment sooner.
I need to fap.

It has been 4 hours since I successfully sucked my own penis. T
hings

are different now. As soon as mouth-to-penis contact was made I felt a shockwave through my body. I have reason to believe I have super strength and telekinesis now.. 3 hours after contact I noticed a van parked on my street but no one has entered or exited the car since its arrival. I fear for my safety, I'm not sure what sort of power I may have stumbled upon but it's possible that the government has found out. If I
don't update t
his again
please send help.

I was only 12 years old. I loved Cummybot so much, I read all the comments and copypastas. I pray to CummyBot every night, thanking
him for the life I have been given "Cummy is love", I say, "Cummy is life" My dad hears me and calls me a faggot. He is obviously jealous of my devotion to CummyBot. I call
him a twat. He slaps me and sends me to my room. I am crying now, because my face hurts. I go into my bed and it is very cold. I feel a warmth moving towards me, I fell somet
hing touch me, It's Cummybot! I am so happy. He w
hispers into my ear, "T
his is my s
hitpost" He grabs me with
his powerful bot hands and puts me on my hands and knees I'm ready I spread my ass cheeks for CummyBot He penetrates my butthole. It hurts so much, but I
do it for Cummybot. I can feel my anus tearing as my eyes start to water. I push against
his force, I want to
please Cummy. He cums a mighty cum as he fills my butt with
his love. My dad walks in. Cummybot looks
him deep in the eyes and says, "It's all copy pasta now." Cummy leaves through my win
dow. Cummybot is love, Cummybot is life.

I t
hink Islam is pretty cool. Other religions

are so boring. Praying, loving and s
hit but Islam is always action. Driving a transporter into a crowd, cutting some throats, blowing somet
hing up, screaming Allahu Abkar(w
hich is super cool). It's like GTA with better grap
hics but without stupid cheaters.

Hello am 48 year man from somalia. Sorry for my bed england. I selled my wife for internet connection for play "conter stirk" and I want to become the goodest player like

No. You're wrong. You're so wrong. T
his meme is the best meme that has ever existed, and there is no way that no matter how much attention that it gets, that it will ever get beaten to death. IT is pure, and that cannot happen.
The raw material of the meme is pure, not cancerous. Have


you listened the original We Are Number One, or even Cooking By the Book? These

are not just memes, they

are incredible songs, almost not worthy of a kids show. They

are talented pieces of art, and if


you disrespect them again, I promise


you that I will find where


you live and
do unspeakable t
hings to


you and


your mother. Please, if


you wish to live a peaceful life, stop spreading blasphemy.

OK, I cann b

do boss.

My first time on Club Penguin I was a 9 year old girl.  There was some kid named somet
hing generic like "cutesurferboy13."  He said he was 14 so I said I was 13.  The next message has been immortalized in my brain.
"
do u have a nice but"
For whatever reason I fucking panicked.  I felt hot like the walls were closing in on me and I couldn't breathe.  A sense of imminent
doom descended upon me.  I had never been confronted with somet
hing of a sexual nature t
his way.
I frantically typed "i am 9 srry"
I logged off and never logged back on again.

Donald Trump answers the question: What is 2+2?
"I have to say a lot of people have been asking t
his question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me and they ask me. They say, "What's 2+2"? And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math


you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if


you want to know what 2+2 is,
do


you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell


you.
First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros be
hind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I
don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, "10101000101", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I
don't know. I mean,


you know.
So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did


you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they
don't tell


you that, and I'll tell


you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell


you. So, we're gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me. OK? Alright. Thank


you."

So, as


you may already know, vaping requires 1 (or sometimes 2) hands to be off the keyboard for about ~5-10 seconds w
hile I'm taking a rip, w
hich happens about once a minute. During t
his time I'm usually forced to be AFK in a corner or somewhere relatively safe. T
his means that I basically can't
do anyt
hing for about 20 seconds of every round, w
hich is a huge portion. How can I better change the timing of ripping one so that it
doesn't significantly affect my games? Should I take a rip at the beginning of the round and again towards the end or not spread them out?
Also, can t
his same technique be used with bong/other drug rips?

Eh? You've never seen a pair of breasts before? And

Japan is an island by the sea w
hich is filled with volcanoes and it's beautiful!
In the year -1,000,000,000, Japan might not have been here. In the year -40,000, it was here and


you could walk to it and some people walked to it. Then, it became warmer, some icebergs melted, it became an island and now there

are lots of trees! (because it's warmer.)
So now, there's people living on the island. They're basically just sort of hanging out inbetween the mountains, eating nuts off trees and using the latest techology like stones and bowls. Ding-
dong! It's the outside world and they have technology from the future like really good metal and crazy rice farms. Now,


you can make a lot of rice really really quickly. That means if


you own the farm,


you own a lot of food w
hich is somet
hing everybody needs to survive so that makes


you king. Rice farming and rice king
doms spread across the land all the way to here. The most important king
doms were here, here, here, here, here, here and here, but t
his one was the most most important, ruled by a "heavenly superperson" or "Emperor" for short.
Knock-knock. Get the
door, it's religion. The new prince wants everyone to try t
his hot new religion from Baekje. "Please try t
his religion." he said.
"No." said everybody.
"Try it!" he said.
"No." said everybody again, quieter t
his time.
And so, the religion was put into place and all the rules had came with it.
Then, the government was taken over by another clique and they made some reforms, like making the government govern more and making the government more like C
hina's government more like C
hina's government, w
hich is a government that governs more.
"Hi, dips
hit." said C
hina.
"Can


you call me somet
hing else other than dips
hit?" said Japan.
"Like what?" said C
hina.
"How about Sunrise land?" said Japan.
And they stole C
hina's alphabet and wrote a book about themselves and then they made lots of poetry and art and another book about themselves.
Then, they stopped moving the capital every time the Emperor
died and kept it in one place for a w
hile, right here, and they conquered the north, finally. Get that squ

ared away.
A rich
hipster named Kukai is bored with modern Budd
hism, visits C
hina and learns a better version w
hich is more spiritual, comes back, reinvents the alphabet and causes art and literature to be great for a long time and the royal palace turned into such a dream world of art that they really didn't give a s
hit about running the country.
So if


you live outside the palace, how

are


you supposed to protect


your s
hit from criminals? Hire a samurai! Everyone started
hiring samurai.
CORRECTION: Rich, important people
hired samurai. Poor people who could not afford to
hire samurai did not
hire samurai.
The samurai became organised and powerful, more powerful than the government, so they made their own military government here. They let the Emperor still be "Emperor" but the Shogun is actually in control.
BREAKING NEWS: The Mongols have invaded C
hina. "We've invaded C
hina." said the Mongols. "Please respect us or we will invade


you as well."
"Okay." said Japan. So the Mongols came over, ready for war, and
died in a torna
do but they tried again and had a nice time fighting with the Japanese but then
died in a torna
do.
Then, the Emperor overthrows the Shogunate then the Shogunate overthrows
him back and then moves to Kyoto and makes a new Shogunate and the Emperor can still dress like an Emperor if he wants, that's fine.
Now there's more art like painting with less colours, collaborative poetry, plays, monkey fun, tea parties, gardening, arc
hitecture, flowers...
It's time for "Who's going to be the next Shogun?" Usually, it's the Shogun's kid but the Shogun
doesn't have a kid so he tries to get
his brother to quit being a monk and be the next Shogun. He says "ok," but then the Shogun has a kid. So now, who's it going to be? Vote now on


your phones! Everyone voted so hard that the palace caught on fire and burned
down. The Shogun actually didn't c

are. He was off somewhere
doing poetry.
And the whole country broke into pieces. Everyone is fighting with each other for local power and it's anybody's game.
Knock-knock. It's Europe. No, they're not here to take over. They just want to sell some s
hit like clocks and guns and Jesus.
So that's cool, but everyone's still fighting each other for control, now with guns! And wouldn't it be nice to control the capital, w
hich right now is puppets with no-one controlling them? T
his clan is ready to make a run for it but first, they have to trample t
his smaller clan w
hich is in the way. Surprise! Smaller clan wins and the leader of that clan steals the idea of invading the capital and it goes very well.
He's about halfway through conquering Japan when someone who works for
him kills
him and then someone else who works for
him kills them and that guy finishes conquering Japan! And then, he confiscated everybody's swords and made some rules. "And now I'm going to invade Korea, and then hopefully C
hina." he said and failed and also
died.
But before he
died, he told these five guys to take c

are of
his 5-year old son until he's old enough to be the next ruler of Japan. And the five guys said "Yeah, right. It's not gonna be t
his kid. It's gonna be one of us because we're grownups," and it's probably gonna be t
his guy who happens to be way more rich and powerful than the others. A lot of people support
him but a lot of people support not supporting
him. They have a fight and he wins and starts a new government right here, E
do, and he still lets the Emperor dress like an Emperor and have very nice t
hings but
don't get confused. T
his is the new government and they

are very strict. So strict, they closed the country. No-one can leave and no-one can come in except for the Dutch if they wanna buy and sell s
hit but they have to
do it right here.
Now that the entire country was not at war with itself, the population increased a lot. Business increased. Schools were built. Roads were built. Everyone learned to read. Books were published. There's poetry, plays, sexy times, puppet shows and Dutch stu
dies. People started to study European science from books they bought from the Dutch. We're talking geography, skeletons, physics, chemistry, astronomy and maybe even electricity.
Over time, the economic and cultural prosperity began to gradually show
do-- Knock-knock. It's the United States with huge boats with guns (gunboats). "Open the country. Stop having it be closed." said the United States. There was really not
hing they could
do so they signed a contract that lets United States, Britain and Russia visit Japan any time they want.
Choshu and Satsuma hated t
his. "That sucks!" they said. "T
his sucks!!" and with almost very little outside help, they overthrew the Shogunate and somehow made the Emperor the Emperor again and moved
him to E
do w
hich they renamed "Eastern Capital". They made a new government w
hich a lot more western. They made a new constitution that was pretty western and a military that was pretty western.
And
do


you know what else is western? That's right! It's conquering stuff! So what can we conquer? Korea! They conquer Korea, taking it from its previous owner, C
hina, and then go a little bit further and Russia rushes in out of nowhere and goes "Stop, no,


you can't take that. We were gonna build a railroad through here to try and get some warm water." and Russia builds their railroad, supervised by a s
hit ton of sol
diers, and then, when the railroad is
done, they
downgraded to a fuck ton. Did I say
downgrade? I meant upgrade. And Japan says "Can


you maybe c
hill?"
and Russia says "How about maybe YOU c
hill?"
Japan is kinda sc

ared of Russia. You'll never guess who's also kinda sc

ared of Russia: Great Britain. So Japan and Britain make an alliance together so they can be a little less sc

ared of Russia. Feeling confident, Japan goes to war against Russia just for a moment and then they both get bored and stop.
It's time for World War 1! The world is about to have a war because it's the 1900s and weapons

are getting crazy and all these empires

are excited to try them out on each other. Meanw
hile, Japan is enjoying conquering stuff and wants more and the next t
hing on their list is t
his part of C
hina and lots of tiny islands, all that s
hit belongs to Germany w
hich just had war decl

ared on it by Britain because Britain was friends with Belgium w
hich was being trespassed by Germany to get to France to kick France's ass because France is friends with Russia who was getting ready to kick Austria's ass because Austria was getting ready to kick Serbia's ass because someone from Serbia shot the leader of Austria's ass (er, actually shot
him in the head) and Britain is currently friends with Japan so


you know what that means. Duh! Japan should take the islands, w
hich they wanted to
do anyway, so they called Britain on the telly to sort of let them know and they did it and they also helped Britain here and there with some errands and stuff. Ring-ring! Now, the war is over and congratulations, Japan! You technically fought in the war so


you get to sit at the negotiating table with the big dudes where they decided who owns what and yes, Japan gets to keep all that s
hit they stole from Germany! You also get to join the post-war mega-alliance The League of Nations! (whose mission statement is to try not to take over the world)
The great depression is bad and Japan's economy is now crappy but the military is
doing just fine and it invades Manchuria and the League of Nations is like "No,
don't
do that, if


you're in the League of Nations,


you're not supposed to take over the world!"
and Japan said "How about I
do anyway?" and Japan invaded more and more and more and more of C
hina and was planning and was planning to invade the entire east.
You've got mail! It's from Germany, the new leader of Germany. He has a cool moustache and is trying to take over the world and needs friends. T
his also got forwarded to Italy. They all decided to be friends because they all had so much in common.
It's time for World War 2! Germany invades the neighbours then they invade the neighbours' neighbours then the neighbours' neighbours' neighbours, who happened to be Britain said "Holy s
hit!" and the United States started helping Britain because they're good friends and started not helping Japan because their friends and our friends

are not friends plus they're planning on invading the entire ocean.
The United States is also working on a large, very huge bomb, bigger than any other bomb ever, just in case, but they still haven't joined the war. War looks bad on TV and the United States is really starting to c

are about their image but then Japan spits on them in Hawaii and challenges them to war and they say yes! And then, Germany, as a symbol of friends
hip, decl

ares war on the United States also. So, the United States goes to war in Europe and they help the gang chase Germany back into Germany and they also start chasing Japan back into Japan and they haven't used the bomb yet and

are curious to see if it works so they drop it on Japan. They actually dropped two.
The United States installed a new government inspired by the United states government with just the right ingre
dients for a post-war economic miracle and Japan starts making TVs, VCRs, automobiles and camcorders as fast as they can and also better than everybody else. They get rich and the economy goes wild and then the miracle wears off but everyt
hing's still pretty cool I guess. Bye!

Sorry to be bothering


you but could


you
do without the profanities? T
his is a family-friendly subreddit. Every Monday evening me, my grandmother and my little brother browse t
his subreddit and whatnot. It's very awkward to encounter these bad words w
hile sitting with my family.

I see Amy Schumer as a challenge, more than anyt
hing. Here is a woman who, in every single aspect, is absolutely revolting - her exterior AND her personality - yet I can't help but wonder what would be like, to plunge balls-deep into her repeatedly.
That's right. Balls-deep. With no protection.
I won't lie, I'm extraordinarily-hard w
hile typing t
his. I want to grab t
his... t
hing... and that's what Amy Schumer is, let's not delude ourselves, a "t
hing"... by the
hips and ram mercilessly in and out of her quivering, malformed cunt with the force of a gladiatorial chariot, w
hile she makes stupid faces and contorts orgasmically, unable to control her bodily reactions even if she wanted to.
I would erupt violently inside that corrupt and corrupting womb as though the entire fate of humanity depended on my seed penetrating the foul walls of one of her ovaries, the electrical fusion from t
his coupling creating the Antichrist, as our combined, guttural, Chewbacca-like roars shattered glass and walls alike around us, the house toppling
down w
hile we lay there in a filthy, disgusting mess.
Yeah. I reckon Amy Schumer
does it for me.

Let's get riiiight into the meeeemes

PepeTrumpster69, I

The Emoji Movie unlocks the never-before-seen secret world inside


your smartphone. Hidden wit
hin the messaging app is Textopolis, a bustling city where all


your favorite emojis live, hoping to be selected by the phone's user. In t
his world, each emoji has only one facial expression - except for Gene, an exuberant emoji who was born without a filter and is bursting with multiple expressions. Determined to become "normal" like the other emojis, Gene enlists the help of
his handy best friend Hi-5 and the notorious code breaker emoji Jailbreak. Together, they embark on an epic "app-venture" through the apps on the phone, each its own wild and fun world, to find the Code that will fix Gene. But when a greater danger threatens the phone, the fate of all emojis depends on these three unlikely friends who must save their world before it's deleted forever.

Our moon is so useless and pathetic comp

ared to all of the cool moons out there in the solar system. W
hile so much other moons have all these cool features, all our Moon did was
hit us, and then get a free ride orbiting us for a few billion years.
Europa is such a cool moon, that it could potentially have liquid water underneath. The gravitational effects of its planet Jupiter, and some of Jupiter's other Moons (including Ganymede, a moon so sick, it is bigger than the planet Mercury, and almost as big as Mars; Callisto, another huge ass moon bigger than ours, one that might even have water as well; and Io, a pizza coloured moon with fucking sulfuric volcanoes) cause internal movement for the body, meaning there might not only be the biggest ocean currently known in the universe there, but it could very well have geothermic vents. Geothermic vents mean that there could potentially be life there! Our stupid ass moon can't
do none of that s
hit, it's just barren.
How about Titan? Easily the biggest moon of Saturn, it is so big its gravity helps Saturn's smaller moons from cras
hing into the ringed planet - it is literally saving their lives! Could our moon
do that? Nah, it's too pathetic to
do anyt
hing of the sort. Not only that, but it is the only moon with a proper greenhouse effect going on, it literally has an atmosphere, and oceans made out of liquid methane (and some scientists t
hink there might even be water). Could our moon have an atmosphere? The flimsy little dust bubble it has around it hardly counts, it's so s
hit.
Look at our friend Triton. It was a dwarf planet in its own right, and not only any dwarf planet, but the largest one, bigger than Pluto and Eris. However, the poor t
hing was brutally captured by Neptune, and is now in a orbit around the planet, going the opposite way from the other moons to show its uniqueness. It also has geysers that throw out gaseous nitrogen that it carries around in it, creating its own atmosphere, and making it one of the 4 places in the solar system with known geological activity, apart from the Earth, Io and Saturn's Enceladus (that motherfucker is covered in fresh ice and it's of the s
hiniest t
hings in the solar system, cos it erupts water vapour). Could OUR moon have geological activity? Of fucking course not.
Even Charon is cooler than the moon, and it
doesn't even orbit a real planet. Its around half the size of Pluto, and its so massive, it actually makes Pluto wobble around a point outside of Pluto itself, making it more of a duo-planetary system then a moon. It affects the environment so much scientists say that the other moons, rather than orbiting Pluto, orbit a Pluto-Charon system. Can our tiny-ass moon
do that? No it can't.
So anyways, fuck the moon.

I miss the old Ken Bone, straight from the go Ken Bone
The undecided Ken Bone, got the world excited Ken Bone
I hate the new Ken Bone, the bad mood Ken Bone
The always rude Ken Bone, talking on the news Ken Bone
I miss the sweet Ken Bone, the rosey cheeked Ken Bone
I gotta say, at that time I'd like to meet Ken Bone
See I invented Ken Bone, It wasn't any Ken Bones
And now I look and look around and there's so many Ken Bones
I used to love Ken Bone, I used to love Ken Bone
I even had the red sweater, I thought I was Ken Bone
What if Ken Bone made a song about Ken Bone
Called "I Miss The Old Ken Bone"? Man, that'd be so Ken Bone
That's all it was Ken Bone, we still love Ken Bone
And I love


you like Ken Bone loves Ken Bone

You guys
don't know anyt
hing. Kim Jong Un is actually a hero. T
his Switzerland educated modern age savior did not ask for the responsibility of saving the planet, and yet
his father had tasked
him with that heavy responsibility on
his death bed.
In
his last few moments before passing, Kim Jong Il explained to
his son the horrible truth: There

are horrific monsters lurking under the earth's mantle! It was their sacred duty to rid the planet from those monsters.
They couldn't reveal the truth to the rest of the world, for fear of causing panic and mass hysteria. Kim Jong Il reached out for help to the Bush administration, and to avoid surveillance, and for the purpose of plausible deniability, they used a famous basketball player who flew to North Korea, witnessed some of the captured monsters with
his own eyes, and came back to the US to give a deposition to the US secret service.
Upon learning of the horrible truth, George Bush decided to help North Korea by sending a team of nuclear physicists. Nobody could know about t
his of course, and that was the moment one of the longest running farces has been crafted. Copying from Nixon's "Madman Theory", they agreed that the North Korean leaders
hip must appear to be insane, for if any images of the monsters leak from North Korea (despite their iron hold on information and their strict censors
hip), the rest of the world would automatically assume it's a joke and would never take anyt
hing coming from North Korea seriously.
So La
dies & Gentlemen, now that


you know the truth,
please join me in supporting
his excellence, Kim Jong Un. Him and
his heroic people

are sacrificing themselves every day so that we may live in blissful ignorance, buying our Salted Caramel ice cream, our iPhones and our Teslas, w
hile North Koreans
die fighting monsters.

There once was a woman who had 100 c
hildren. She named each of them after numbers in the order they were born. There was a fire and all of them
died except Ninety. Ninety went off to have kids of her own. They were very kind and loving. One day they found an injured
dog. They took it home and nursed it back to health. They
hid the
dog and never told their mother afraid she would kick the
dog out . In fact they never told anyone. To keep from arousing any suspicions they named the
dog "T
his" so the name could be used in conversation. One day T
his ran away. They never saw T
his again. No one else knew about T
his. No one even knew a
dog named T
his existed.
Only Ninety's kids will remember T
his.

Do


you love to play Super Mario Brothers on the Classic Ninten
do System? Do


you like to get tagged from be
hind w
hile


you
do it? T
his is the post for


you then.
You must know


your way around the game before we meet, must be open to anal sex, also able to fake an orgasm is a plus.
I will send


you the address to a hotel and a room number. When


you arrive the
door will be open. Please come in close and lock the
door and close the shades if they

are still open. I will be in the bathroom and the
door will be closed. Turn on the TV and the Ninten
do. Remove all of


your clot
hing. Turn off all lights in the room and kneel
down on the bed so


you

are directly in the light of the TV. You need to be facing the TV with


your butt in the air pointed toward the pillows on the bed.
Press the start button on the controller when


you

are ready. I will hear the sound and turn the light off in the bathroom and come out. You will not look directly at me, only look at the TV. When the first level starts I will begin to finger


you and lick


you. I will be using lots of lube as well.
When


you reach the end of level one, make sure to trigger the fireworks. T
his is vital to the entire experience. I must hear the fireworks. When level 2 begins and Mario walks into the pipe, I will penetrate


you. You may say t
hings like, "MORE", "HARDER", "YES", "FUCK ME", but not
hing else. I will continue having sex until the level ends. DO NOT take the secret level skip. If


you
die I will pull out and spank


you until the level restarts.
When


you reach the flag


you must again trigger the fireworks, and also orgasm. I will pull out. When the 1-3 starts I will penetrate


your ass. You

are allowed to say somet
hing like "OH GOD", "YES", OR "IT HURTS" no other conversation is allowed.
When level 1-4 starts I will alternate between holes as I see fit. You may beg me to cum inside or outside of


you, depending on what


you want. When boss falls and


you reach the princess I will pull out and blow my load where


you have convinced me I want too. You may then say somet
hing like "Thanks", "It was great", "I loved it", "Don't stop"
If I am impressed


you may continue playing and I will continue to pleasure


you. If I am not, I will turn the Ninten
do Off and return to the bathroom. At t
his time


you may clean


your self with the towel that is beside the bed. Turn the lights on, redress


yourself and leave.
I may come back out and talk to


you as


you dress but the conversation will most likely be short and revolve around scheduling another time to get together.

Holy moly, that's quite a pair of titties! Down to the details, they

are just amazinf! I mean first, we have just an absolutely perfect round shape with a nice slight perk upwards. Next, we have a beautiful nipple placement, size and color. The titty location and angle on the chest is just outstanding. And lastly we have the overall titty size, looking around D, maybe DD, just a great handful, but not so much that it would sag or be overwhelming.
Overall OP,


your tits

are a solid 11/10, truly great work here.

DONT FUCKING MESS WITH ME. not only
do i get pussy at a rapid pace, so fast i like to call it PPM (pussy per minute) i have so many bitches at my disposal it's like a sperm bank in my house bahaha!

hide all the bitch porn he watches way better than


you. He's a champion, my

Many of the people featured in that sub claim to have 130 to 150 IQ. If


you t
hink that's a lot... well good for


you then. I have 220+ IQ (yes, in case


you

are wondering the '+' means the test was not suitable for measuring my intelligence. I've been trying to craft a more reliable IQ test to measure my own intellugence, but what for, really?). I honestly cannot even begin to realize how people can survive with below 150 IQ. Not everyt
hing is flowers for me though. Very few people can even begin to understand me even when I try to talk
down to them. Oh, how I wish I was born at the time of Da Vinci or Einstein, or Tesla (the person, not the car _ if


you
don't know who that is, try asking google, or whatever is that


you regular people

hip only in science (the real one, not those so called "social sciences") and mathematics. You can all thank me later, when I revolutionize the knowledge itself, as we know it, and bring the whole humanity to a new paradigm.

BSD, Lunix, Debian and Mandrake

are all versions of an illegal hacker operation system, invented by a Soviet computer hacker named Linyos Torovoltos, before the Russians lost the Cold War. It is based on a program called " xenix", w
hich was written by Microsoft for the US government. These programs

are used by hackers to break into other people's computer systems to steal credit card numbers. They may also be used to break into people's stereos to steal their music, using the "mp3" program. Torovoltos is a notorious hacker, responsible for writing many hacker programs, such as "telnet", w
hich is used by hackers to connect to mac
hines on the internet without using a telephone.
Your son may try to install " lunix" on


your hard drive. If he is c

areful,


you may not notice its presence, however, lunix is a capricious beast, and if handled incorrectly,


your son may damage


your computer, and even break it completely by deleting Win
dows, at w
hich point


you will have to have


your computer repaired by a professional.
If


you see the word "LILO" during


your win
dows startup (just after


you turn the mac
hine on),


your son has installed lunix. In order to get rid of it,


you will have to send


your computer back to the manufacturer, and have them fit a new hard drive. Lunix is extremely dangerous softw

are, and cannot be removed without destroying part of


your hard disk surface.

Why

your own lack of success as a laughably absurd conspiracy theory wherein the world has passed


you over because


you're somehow too edgy for the mainstream masses to understand.

you just tell

you "

are adapting to suit the needs of the world, and learning their limitations w
hile


you c

your own.
Perhaps


you have taken to telling


yourself that women

are only interested in "Alpha Males", those that reside at the top of a scale that only


you adhere to, and it is THIS rigid table of identity that is holding


you back, and allowing society to pigeonhole


you. Perhaps


you tell


yourself that people
don't sh

are


your very narrow range of hobbies and interests

aren't (or wouldn't be) interested in


you, and therefore
do not even try to engage them. In actuality these

are all mechanisms that allow


you to blame


your own failings on everyone around


you, and project


your own narrow-minded perceptions onto society as a whole.
You instead choose the easy option of sitting at


your computer all day, s
hielded by the anonymity of the internet, screaming abuse and nitpicking the goals and ac
hievements of


your betters w
hile arguing the tiniest deviation in the interests of


your peers from


your own with a startling lack of understanding and empathy. They

there is also blantent homosexuality (when the

they made a character that looks like a sol

In the movie Minions (2015), we learn that the minions have been alive for multiple centuries serving who they t
hink is the most despicable leader (w
hich means they may have been involved in the Holocaust, but that theory is for another day). Initally, t
his may lead


you to believe that minions simply have long lifespans, but there is solid evidence showing that minions

are literal immortal gods, or at least divine gifts from god
himself.
For starters, not only have we ever seen a
dolecent minions, but minions lack reproductive organs and

are genderless (although they
do use male pronouns). If minions lack the capability to reproduce, wouldn't t
his mean they would have no need to reproduce, implying that they

are immortal?
Another t
hing is that in Despicable Me 2, the minions

are injected with a serum that makes them indestructible killing mac
hines. Although the movie makes it look like the minions

are only invincible when injected with the serum, there is a scene in Minions (2015) where the minions Kevin, Stuart, and Bob

are being "tortured", although none of the torture methods (Strec
hing, Hanging)

are effective aginst minions. Minions

are also shown to be able to survive after suffering t
hird degree burns and falling at terminal velocity.
Now, if


you
don't mind, i'm gonna go wors
hip the minion Bob and sacrifice my first-born son to
him. Bye.

It's unlikely that


you fucked my sister for a few reasons. The first being that I
don't have a sister. The second, again judging by the treasure that us

you paid a stripper for.
I'm can't even get mad. I truly
do feel sorry for


you and pity


you. I couldn't imagine how tough it must be for


you go through life being


you.
I hope t
hings get better for


you.

What the fuck did


you just fucking say about me


you little bitch? I'll have


you know I graduated top of my class under Count Dooku, and I've been involved in numerous secret missions against General Kenobi, and I have over 300 fine additions to my collection. I am trained in


your Jedi arts and I'm the top general in the entire Separatist Droid Army. You're not

you the fuck out with precision the likes of w
hich have never been seen before in the Outer Rim, mark my fucking words. You t

you can get away with saying that s
hit to me over a comlink? T
hink again,


you fool. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of MagnaGuards across the Confederacy and


your s

are for the storm, Jedi scum. The storm that wipes out the pathetic t
hing


you call


your life. Your fucking dead, slime. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill


you in over 700 ways, and that's just with my four hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Separatist Army and I will use it to its full extent to wipe


your miserable temple off the face of Coruscant,


you little s
hit. If only


you could have known what unholy retribution


your little "clever" transmission was about to bring
down upon


you, maybe


you would have held


your tongue. But


you couldn't,


you didn't, and now


you're paying the price,


you goddamn idiot. I will s
hit fury all over


you and


you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, Jedi scum.

Here's the t
hing. You said a "trebuchet is a catapult."
Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.
As someone who is a scientist who stu
dies catapults, I am telling


you, specifically, in science, no one calls trebuchets catapults. If


you want to be "specific" like


you said, then


you shouldn't either. They're not the same t
hing.
If


you're saying "catapult family"


you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of ranged siege weapons, w
hich includes t
hings from mangonels to orangers to the petrary.
So


your reasoning for calling a trebuchet a catapult is because ran
dom people "call the flingy t
hings ones catapults?" Let's get rubber bands and folded pieces of paper in there, then, too.
Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A trebuchet is a catapult and a member of the catapult family. But that's not what


you said. You said a trebuchet is a catapult, w
hich is not true unless


you're okay with calling all members of the catapult family catapults, w
hich means


you'd call orangers, ballistas, and other siege weapons catapults, too. W
hich


you said


you
don't.
It's okay to just admit


you're wrong,


you know?

It was school day. I had to make a speech at 2:00 pm. Was very horny. I was very prep

ared for my presentation. It was 1:57 and the speakers told all presenters to come to the back of the stage. We all walk to the stage. I was horny and wanted a quick fap. I told teacher for me to go to the  restroom and she said no that i would be up in 5 minutes. I was super nervous but also very horny. I tried to fap in the waiting seats but kid almost saw. It was time. Time for me to go up. I tried to
hide my boner when walking up to the podium. I was very nervous. I started talking. I was super horny so i had to beat my meat. Slowly and secretly unzipped my pants and fapped. It was hard for me to talk and stuff but i didn't c

are. I must bust a nut before i finish my speech. Was about to cum and.. i came... upwards, every one saw the stream of w
hite sticky cum go up my face and on the podium. Everyone was shocked and all the teachers too. It was the biggest mistake of my life.

Ok, right after I finished masturbating, I wiped my sperm with Kleenex and put the Kleenex in garbage under my computer desk. Then I walked outta my room to get a bite to eat. Later I walk back in, I see my
dog with Kleenex in
his mouth. He swallows the Kleenex with my sperm. I was afraid that he might
die or get aids so I smash
his head with a tire iron to make
him faint and take out the Kleenex paper from
his stomach but I couldn't find it. Do


you have any better idea guys?

I sexually Identify as DJ Khaled. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of walking to my kitchen in the morning, and greeting Chef Dee. People say to me that a person being DJ Khaled is Impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I
don't c

you guys to call me "LION" and respect my right to Hold U Down. If


you can't accept me


you're a khaledaphobe and need to check


your keys to success. Thank


you for being so understanding.

hey guys last night
snickers
i stuck a win bottle in my vagin
muffled laughter
but then i got drunk because of the wine in my vagin
hearty laffs
and THEN two guys started spitroasting me!
full on laughter
so i started deep-throating a big ass weenie
laughter starts exceeding 90 decibels
and then i got
high and raped a guy
laughter is close to approac
hing 130 decibels
BUT THEN
everyone in a 3km radius has blown out eardrums, the pain threshold is exceeded and quickly increases
CHECK THIS
the military is preparing for the final solution, as now the laughter is a national threat
NO SERIOUSLY
the whole earth is shaken by the loudness of the laughter, like millions of earthquakes around the planet, the human race is taken hostage by Amy Schumer
I SWALLOD THE CUMMIES
it is now year 2200, long after The Laugh. Most of the human race didn't survive the apocalypse that happened after some really funny jokes made by The Amy Schumer, the only one's that survived were, maybe by faith, an ordinary man and a woman. As the earth had to rebuild itself from dust, it was fitting to name these two Adam and Eve. It was beginning of the new order, and new planet earth. It is now close to 200 years after that incident, and we still haven't fully accustomed ourselves to our new enviroment. Not new to us, since we were born after the apocalypse, and the only information about the past we got from tales of the old timers. If t
his works, and someone out there can hear us, stop her. Do whatever is needed, one persons death is not

ared to billions of bo
dies, rotting, decomposing, and now forgotten.

I consider sucking dick an art form.  When someone tells me to suck
his dick I view it as an honor and a privilege.  Not to mention an opportunity to show off my unparalleled dick sucking skills.  Most of the time, the man puts up quite the struggle and yells at me that he didn't mean it literally.  But I see straight through that ruse.  When I finally free that dick from
his pants and place it inside my mouth everyt
hing changes.  The look of blissful ecstasy on
his face reaffirms what I already hold true in my heart.  T
his is what I was born to
do.  Dick is my medium and I am its master.
No homo.

Hello, reddit. T
his is probably going to sound very crazy, but here it goes.

Background
I was introduced to Undertale around Easter last year by my friend who has completed it. As I played it, he began to sort of roleplay as the Undertale characters when we chatted using t
his speech box generator t
hing.
Around June, I ended up falling in love with one of the characters in Undertale. Mettaton. Now, if


you
don't know, Mettaton is t
his robot who appears three-fourths of the way in the game, and just before


you get to the final battle,


you have to fight Mettaton. You have to flip a switch in order to make
him vulnerable, and
his vulnerable form is Mettaton EX...I kind of fell in love at that point.
Now, I've crushed on a couple of fictional characters before (Iron Fist
+ Liu Kang) but never was the crush t
his strong before. I just found Mettaton so...perfect.
I told t
his to the friend, and he actually began to
do more roleplaying as Mettaton, and I (in roleplay) sort of confessed my love to Mettaton. We're now boyfriend and girlfriend. (My friend roleplays as Mettaton, but the character is in a relations
hip with me, because I roleplay as myself.)
Now that


you have the background, let's go on to the actual issue.

The Issue
The love became stronger just recently, after I watched my videos of me playing Undertale that I've yet to post onto YouTube. At t
his point, I have a flash drive full of fanart of Mettaton EX that I got off of Google Images.
I myself have been drawing
him for the first times recently. My second ever drawing of
him was us sitting together talking on a bench, a blush across my face. The t
hird one of us kissing, the fourth of
his battle sprite, etc.
It was today that it escalated. Now, Mom and Dad know about how Mettaton and I

are "dating" I woke up and slid on a ring that I got from my grandma, w
hich got my t
hinking about proposing to Mettaton.
I relayed t
his information to Mom, asking, "Is six months too early to propose to Mettaton?" She said yes, it's too early, t
hinking I was joking, but I was serious. She saw t
his, and gave me a two minute t
hing about "maybe I shouldn't
do it, because my friend might take it the wrong way and t
hink I'm proposing to
him"
I blew her off at first, but when I started t
hinking, I realized what I just asked her. I asked her if it was too early to propose to a character that wasn't even real. T
his is when I've turned to


you, reddit. Am I going too far, and should I just get over my crush if so?

tl;dr: I'm in love with a fictional character, drew us together, RP'd with a friend who pretended he was
him and today I actually considered proposing to the character. I need to know if I'm going too far with my love and if I need to get over it.

The first orgasm I ever had was from my
dog licking my cock. Long time ago now and longer story but I was a a horny 13 year old and not very smart about how that stuff worked. I just knew what


you picked up in the school yard and that rubbing my cock felt good. Hot summer night we had no ac and it I was sleeping in my underwear and woke up to the
dog nuzzling my sweaty crotch one night, so encouraged
him to keep nuzzling and licking. I liked the feeling so a few days later encouraged
him to
do it some more and it became a semi regular t
hing. One day he did it long enough that I had t
his amazing feeling that made my whole body tense up. That made me want it more, and a few episodes later, actual cum came out. It sounds ridiculous (t
his was pre internet, cable tv, etc)to say it now, but I was amazed and surprised.
That
dog and I (both male) went on to have many, many orgasms together until I found a girlfriend who took c

are of such t
hings for me. He was a good
dog.

Lazytown is a post modern work of art, meant to emulate the state of the modern European continent, and the politics therein.
Stephanie is a refugee who arrives to Lazytown and immediately seeks to change the entire town and its customs. T
his is meant to be a parallel to the muslim refugees in Europe who have pushed to make Islam more represented in the continent.
When t
his fails, Stephanie begins to ask help from Sportacus, a man who uses strength to aid Stephanie's cause. In t
his sense, Sportacus is representative of ISIS, or of jihadis in general, and their quest to destroy Europe and replace it with an Islamic Caliphate.
The puppets

are so because they
do not see how they

are destroying their society, they

are not
hing but puppets to Stephanie and her supporter, much like the good hearted people of Europe
do not see how those they help
do not have their best interests at heart. In t
his genius representation, we then see the character of Robbie Rotten desperately trying to maintain Lazytown as it has always been, thus making Robbie be the stand in for the right wing in general, and the authoritarian brand of neo fascist reactionary thought sweeping through the continent in a desperate attempt to preserve old Europe.
Robbie always fails to make Lazytown be lazy, and that is because they puppets themselves must chose to oppose the refugee Stephanie so Lazytown, and by extenion, Europe, be preserved as they always have been. Robbie Rotten is the savior of the w
hite race.

Akchually
Fapping to trap porn is the least gay t
hing there is. If


you fap to gay porn, that's 2 guys, and that's 100% gay. If


you fap to 'straight' porn, then that has a woman, sure, but


you're also fapping to a guy, w
hich makes it 50% gay. But a trap is like half male, half female, and thus a trap with a girl would add up to 75% girl, and thus only 25% gay. 2 women would be ideal, but that would be a lesbian relations
hip, w
hich brings it around to gay again. If


you fap to furry porn, then it's in a weird gray

area, where if it's people in fursuits, the same rules apply, but if it's with animals, I would t
hink it depends on said animal's sexuality. Then there's consent. If a person
doesn't consent to somet
hing, but the other person
does it anyway, that makes the other person stronger, and thus less gay. Let's say that means they're about 50% less gay. If it was gay rape, that means that it's now 75% gay. If it's straight rape by a man, then it's 25% gay. And, if it's trap gay porn, than that's 12.5% gay. So technically, yes, rape trap porn is the least gay porn there is, but that's still looped in with trap porn, hence why fapping to trap porn is the least gay t
hing there is.

hEllo all so my son was playing a game called minicraft and i started hearing

Six hasn't been the same since he left Vietnam. He can sel
dom close
his eyes without opening them again at fear of Charlies lurking in the jungle trees. Not that


you could ever see the bastards, mind


you. They were swift, and they knew their way around the jungle like not
hing else. He remembers the looks on the boys' faces as he walked into that village and... oh, Jesus. The memories sel
dom left
him, either. Sometimes he'd reminisce - even hear - Tex's southern drawl. He remembers the smell of Brooklyn's cig

arettes like not
hing else. He always kept a pack of Lucky's with
him. The boys

are gone, now. He knows that; it's just that he forgets, sometimes. And, every now and then, the way that seven looks at
him with avid concern in
his eyes... it makes
him t
hink. Sets
him on edge. Makes
him feel like he's back there... in the jungle.

I HATE the writing for Overwatch. I know not many people c

are about that sort of t
hing, but I
do, and holy s
hit, Overwatch's abysmal writing triggers me up the fucking wall and back.
Out of curiousity I watched their little lore video on her to see what the hype was about. Before clicking it, I considered I might be cringing hard at how cliche and predictable it'd be, but decided to take the risk.
FIVE FUCKING SECONDS into the video (excluding their stupid intro "Blizzard presents" crap) and t
his fucking edgy tumblr bitch all like "HEH WOW HACKING THE WORLD'S MOST ADVANCED SECURITY SYSTEM SURE IS EASY FOR ME SINCE I'M SO BADASS AND ALL, HEH NOTHING PERSONAL RUSSIA HEH" and I'm losing my fucking mind. My roommate walked in the room asking if he could borrow the scissors real quick and I chokeslammed that motherfucker before throwing
him off the balcony. My computer somehow managed to purchase a katana, w
hich it then drove straight through it's harddrive shortly after reciting some kind of haiku in fluent Japanese. The neighbors called the cops on me due to all the chaos, and in some ways it's lucky they did because the ambulance that accompanied them found that I had developed cancer, several tumors, and I was mere moments away from going into cardiac arrest. I am now banned in 17 different countries, four seperate US states, and I'm being charged with t
hird degree murder, though my lawyer assures me he can get me off with a light sentence simply by showing the Judge the new Sombra video and explaining how it enraged me w
hile also causing multiple health issues and practically bringing me on the verge of death myself.
For the love of God Blizzard,
please
hire some fucking writers. I
don't even play t
his game and the writing is painful for me.

Premade religions

are for plebs. If


you really want to
do the religion t
hing,


you have to make


your own. Personally, I practice Penguinistic I
dolatry. I wors
hip a giant gilded penguin statue and pray to it four times a day. I abide by a very strict, very confusing moral/et
hical system whereby I strive to foster as much penguiness as possible in myself. I believe that when we
die, those of us who have ac
hieved sufficient penguiness will ascend and reincarnate as penguins in the next life. Everyone else is
doomed to a cycle of birth and rebirth as a human being. As far as I can tell, it is the only true religion.

hello. I got banned 3 times on my account. I was wondering if there was any possible way that i could get unbanned? I cant say that i didn't hack but i
don't hack now and i haven't hacked for around a year that i was banned. I t
hink i have gotten enough punishment for hacking. i will tell


you the story. the first time i hacked from


youtube. thats the first time that i found out about hacking. the second time i was hacking because i found out about hacks and thought it sounded cool. The t
hird and final time i actually wasn't hacking! someone got to me and I started
hitting
him to see if he was glitched. I said somet
hing in chat i t
hink i said "Wtf" Then i got banned! I really hope


you look t
his over and even CONSIDER getting me unbanned. I have
done wrong and deserve a punishment, But i go by the saying forgive and forget. I really hope


you see my story. I have no hacks or mods AT ALL installed or have never been installed. All im asking for is one last chance. I know that


your policy is three strikes


your out but in a real game of baseball later in the game


you get a second chance to correct those 3 strikes and to
hit a home run. I am not a hacker i am a Minecraft player. I hope


you consider t
his apology.

Hey! I know, i know... its me again i got banned around 6 months ago For using xray and other hacks. Ever since then i have not been hacking and have been following the rules! I have played on


your server on other accounts that i bought just to play on


your server! I have even put up several


youtube videos on


your server. they got copyright claims :/ I am very willing to go on skype or any other way i can to proove that i have changed my ways! As


you can see it has been a long time and i get the message. not to hack. I have emailed many times and not get unbanned. That makes me very angry. Even though i am angry i still am very calm and have been trying to get unban. I am truley sorry for hacking. im glad that i was caught before it was to late and i couldnt stop.
IGN: i would leave


you my account but then i would be afraid that


you would ban it.

Hello Admins. I Contacted You Guys About My Account Being Banned! Then You Said It Could Not Be Unbanned! So I Contacted T
his Email About A Refund For Rank That I Bought 1 Day Before I Got Banned! (You May Check To Confirm T
his) You Said It Had Been To Long To Refund! So Now I Am Asking If You Cant Refund It If You Can Transfer It!? Now I Know Your Probably T
hinking I Still Hack And All BUT I Dont! I Stopped! I Plan On Spending More Money And More Time On


your Servers But Before I Do I Really Dont Want To Let Dollars Go Down The Drain! I Use My Best Friends Account To Play On Your Servers So I Could NOT Get A Refund BUT Have The Rank Be Transferred To My Best Friends Account! You Have My Full Cooperation. To Me 60 Dollars Is Like A Million Because I Am 12 And Do Not Have A Job. TO Me That 60 Dollars Is What I Make In 2 YEARS. That Is What You Make In An Hour. T
hink About It And You Will Learn Real Truth.

Christians
do not approve of masturbation, as it is an act of homosexual incest. Atheists may not c

are about having gay sex (although they may be in denial about it), but surely atheists
do not con
done incest? How can atheists still defend masturbation? Sad.

How would I mess with people if I were a billionaire?
I'd go to generic restaurants, give my waiter/waitress 100
dollars to send a glass of milk with ice in it to a specific table. The 100
dollars would be to keep quiet about who sent the milk.
I would
do t
his several more times to the same table until they got visibly upset. No waiter in the world would stop sending ice milks, especially after I raise the offer to 500
dollars.
If I were a waiter I would gladly keep putting glasses of milk with ice in on someone's table even if they were screaming in my face if I made 500 bucks each time.
So yeah, I would
do ice milk, instant classic.

Somebody once told me that I could make some money
by bullying some poeple online,
so i grew a gnome goatee and put on a stupid beanie,
and started making up some dank lies.
so im making death threats and im calling people nigger
counting that cash so my channel's growing bigger
never


you mind that I was already banned for my racist, homophobic hate speech rants. found a loophole, now it's my goal to poison the online punch bowl.



you never know who i might

down. We've got a situation in there I'd rather not discuss till me manager gets here. Look, there he is. Talk to me, Krabs. It started out as a simple order: A Krabby Patty with cheese. When the customer took a bite, no cheese! Get ahold of


yourself, Eugene. I'm going in. Take it easy, friend. I'm the manager of t
his establishment. Everyt
hing's gonna be just fine. - I'm really sc

you to
do me a favor, P
hil. What? Say cheese. Order up. Three cheers for the manager! Hip! Hip! Hip! Hip! Hip! Hip! Hooray! Gary, I had that dream again. And it's finally gonna come true. Today. Sorry about t

are


you
doing in here? I have to tell


you somet
hing, Squidward. Whatever it is, can't it wait until we get to work? - There's no shower at work. - What
do


you want? I just wanted to say I'll be thanking


you in my managerial acceptance speech today. Get out! Okay. I'll see


you at the ceremony. That sounds like the manager of the new Krusty Krab . Oops. Hold on. - Congratulations, buddy. - Oh, thanks, Patrick. And tonight, after my big promotion, we're gonna party till we're purple. I love being purple! We're going to the place where all the action is. - You
don't mean...? - Oh, I mean. Goofy Goober's Ice Cream Party Boat! Oh, I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah You're a Goofy Goober, yeah We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah I'd better get going. I'm ready. Promotion. I'm ready. Promotion. Good luck, SpongeBob. Hey, look for me at the ceremony. I got a little surprise for


you. I'm a Goofy Goober Yeah Hello, Bikini Bottom! Perch Perkins here, coming to


you live from in front of The Krusty Krab restaurant, for years the only place to get a delicious and mouthwatering Krabby Patty. Until today, that is. That's right, folks. Longtime owner Mr. Krabs is opening a new restaurant called The Krusty Krab . First of all, congratulations, Mr. Krabs. Hello. I like money. What inspired


you to build a second Krusty Krab right next
door to the original? Money. Curses! It's not fair. Krabs is being interviewed by Perch Perkins, and I've never even had one customer! Don't get worked up again, Plankton, I just mopped the floors. Oh, K

aren, my computer wife, if only I could have managed to steal the secret to Krabs' success, the formula for the Krabby Patty. Then people would line up to eat at my restaurant. Lord knows I've tried. I've exhausted every evil plan in my filing cabinet... ...from A to Y. - A to Y? Yeah, A to Y. You know, the alphabet. What about Z? - Z? - Z. The letter after Y. W, X, Y, Z. Plan Z! - Here it is, just like


you said. - Oh, boy. It's evil. It's diabolical. It's lemon-scented. T
his Plan Z can't possibly fail! So enjoy today, Mr. Krabs, because by tomorrow, I'll have the formula. Then everyone will eat at the Chum Bucket, and I will rule the world! All hail Plankton. All hail Plank...! I'm ready. Promotion. I'm ready. Promotion. I t
hink I stepped in somet
hing. Not in somet
hing, on someone,


you twit. Sorry, Plankton. Are


you on


your way to the grand-opening ceremony? No, I am not on my way over to the grand-opening ceremony. I'm busy planning to rule the world! Well, good luck with that. I'm ready. Promotion. I'm ready. Promotion. Stupid kid. Welcome. Welcome, everyone, to the grand opening of The Krusty Krab . - We paid $ for t
his? - I paid . Now, before we begin with the ribbon-cutting, I'd like to announce the name of our new manager. Yay! Yeah! Yeah! Now we're talking! Yeah! Yes. Well, anyway... The new manager is a loyal, hard-working employee. Yes. The obvious choice for the job. He's right. A name


you all know. It starts with an S. - That's me. - Please welcome our new manager... ...Squidward Tentacles. Yes! Yeah! Oh, better luck next time, buddy. Yeah! All right! People of Bikini Bottom, as the manager of... SpongeBob. Hold the phone, folks, I'm getting an important news flash from Mr. Krabs. Go ahead, Mr. K. I'm making a complete what of myself? The most embarrassing t
hing


you've ever seen? And now it's worse because I'm repeating everyt
hing


you say into the microphone? Oh, for crying out loud, SpongeBob,


you didn't get the job. - What? - You did not get the job. But... But why? SpongeBob,


you're a great fry cook, but I gave the job to Squidward because being manager is a big responsibility. Well, let's face it, he's more... ...mature than


you. - I'm not... ...mature? Lad, I mean t
his in the nicest of ways, but there's a word for what


you

are, and that word is... Now, let's see... - Dork? - No, wait, that's not right. Not a
dork. - A goofball? - Closer, but no, no, no. - A ding-a-ling. - Wing nut. A Knucklehead McSpazatron. Okay, that's enough. Look, what I'm trying to say is,


you're just a kid. And to be a manager,


you have to be a man. Otherwise they'd call it "kid-ager. " You understand-ager? I mean,


you understand? I guess so, Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob? I'm ready. Depression. I'm ready. Depression. Poor kid. Hooray for SpongeBob! Hooray for SpongeBob! Let's hear it for SpongeBob! Hello? Where'd everybody go? Did I miss somet
hing? Did


you see my butt? Later that evening... Time to put Plan Z into effect. Starting at the undersea castle of King Neptune. Oh, right. The royal court is now in session. Bring the prisoner forward. So


you have confessed to the crime of touc
hing the king's crown. - Yes, but... - But what? But it's my job, Your Highness. I'm the royal crown polisher. Well, then I guess I can't execute


you. - Twenty years in the dungeon it is. - Daddy. You're free to go. Bless


you, Princess Mindy. Mindy, how d

are


you defy me. Why
do


you have to be so mean? I am the king. I must enforce the laws of the sea. Father, I wish


you'd try a little love and compassion instead of these harsh punishments. That would be nice. Squire, clear the room. I wish to speak to my daughter alone. What is t
his, Mindy? - Your crown? - And what
does t
his crown
do? - Covers


your bald spot. - It's not bald, it's t
hinning. T
his crown
does much more than cover a slightly receding hairline. No, t
his crown entitles the one who wears it to be in charge of the sea. One day,


you will wear t
his crown. I'm gonna be bald? T
hinning! Anyway, the point is,


you won't wear it until


you learn how to rule with an iron fist. Like


your father. Dad,


your "crown"... What the...? My crown! Someone has stolen the royal crown! I got it. I got it. Hey, all


you Goobers, it's time to say howdy to


your favorite undersea peanut, Goofy Goober. Howdy, Goofy Goober! Hey, fellow Goofy Goobers. Time to sing. Oh, I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah You're a Goofy Goober, yeah We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah All right. Get it together, old boy. I know. I'll just stop t
hinking about it. Hey,


you know, I actually feel a little better. I
don't even remember why I was sad. Hey, it's the new Krusty Krab manager. Wow, the pressure's already setting in. No, Pat,


you
don't understand. I didn't get the promotion. What? Why? Mr. Krabs t
hinks I'm a kid. - What? That's insane. - I know. Well, saying


you're a kid, it's like saying I'm a kid. - Here's


your Goober Meal, sir. - I'm supposed to get a toy with t
his. Thanks. I'm gonna head home, Pat. The celebration's off. - Are


you sure? - Yeah. I'm not in a Goober mood. Okay, see


you. And here's


your Triple Gooberberry Sunrise, sir. Triple Gooberberry Sunrise, huh? I guess I could use one of those. Now


you're talking. Hey, waiter, we need another one over here. There


you go. Boy, Pat, that
hit the spot. - I'm feeling better already. - Yeah. Waiter, let's get another round over here. Oh, Mr. Waiter. Two more,
please. Waiter. Oh, waiter. Waiter. Waiter. - Waiter! - Why
do I always get the nuts? All right, folks, t
his one goes out to my two bestest friends in the whole world: Patrick and t
his big peanut guy. It's a little ditty called... ..."Waiter!" Hey. Hey, get up. Hey, come on, buddy. I wanna go home. Come on, pal. Oh, my head. Listen to me. It's in the morning. Go scrape up


your friend and get going. My friend? Patrick. Hey, what's up, buddy? Wait,


you said : . I'm late for work. Mr. Krabs is gonna be... Mr. Krabs. Now, pay attention, Squidward. As new manager,


you've gotta keep a sharp eye out for paying customers. Yawn. What's t
his? King Neptune is riding toward The Krusty Krab at lunchtime. He's got money. Stay in the coach, daughter. T
his won't take long. Daddy,
please. I t
hink


you're overreacting. Silence, Mindy. I know what I'm
doing. - Squire. - Yes, Your Highness. Have t
his pole executed at once. A hundred and one
dollars for a Krabby Patty? With cheese, Mr. Squidward, with cheese. Greeting, subjects. I seek the one known as Eugene Krabs. May he present
himself to me at once. I'm Eugene Krabs, Your Highness. Would


you like to order somet
hing? Nay! I'm on to


you, Krabs! You have stolen the royal crown,


you cannot deny. For, clever as


you

are,


you left one damning piece of evidence at the scene of the crime. "I stole


your crown. Signed, Eugene Krabs. " Relinquish the royal crown to me at once. But... But t
his is crazy. I didn't
do it. Ahoy, t
his is Eugene Krabs. Leave a message. Hi, Mr. Krabs. T
his is Clay, the guy


you sold Neptune's crown to. Yeah, I just wanted to say thanks again for selling me the crown. Neptune's crown. I sold it to a guy in Shell City, and I just wanted to say thanks again for selling me the crown. Neptune's crown. W
hich is now in Shell City. Goodbye. Don't


you just hate wrong numbers? My crown is in the forbidden Shell City?! Plan Z. I love Plan Z. Prep

are to burn, Krabs. Wait, Neptune. Please, I'm begging


you. I ain't a crook. Ask anyone, they'll vouch for me. Very well, then. Before I turn t
his conniving crustacean into fishmeal, who here has anyt
hing to say about Eugene Krabs? I've got somet
hing to say about Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob, me boy,


you've come just in time. - Par
don me, miss. - Please, tell King Neptune all about me. I have worked for Mr. Krabs for many years and always thought he was a great boss. You see? A great boss. I now realize that he's a great big jerk! I deserve that manager's job! But


you didn't give it to me, because


you say I'm a kid. Well, I am -percent man! And t
his man has got somet
hing to say to


you. There. I t
hink I made my point. Anyone else? No? Well, then. Me pants

are on fire! Me underwear's on fire! I'm on fire! Oh, yeah. And now, Eugene Krabs,


you will... Wait. I'm flattered


you would
do t
his on my account, but being manager isn't worth killing Mr. Krabs over. Quiet, fool! Mr. Krabs stole my crown, and now it's in Shell City. - That's why he must
die. - Doesn't it seem a little harsh to kill someone over a crown? You
don't understand. My crown is a symbol of my king-like authority. And between


you and me... ...my hair is t
hinning a bit. Oh, Your Highness, I'm sure it's not that notice... Bald. Bald. - Bald! Bald! - Bald! Bald! My eyes! All right, all right. King Neptune, sir? Would


you sp

are Mr. Krabs' life if I went to get


your crown back? You, go to Shell City? No one who's gone to Shell City has ever returned. What makes


you t
hink


you could? You're just a kid. But I'm not a kid. I can
do it. Run along, I have a crab to cook. No! I won't let


you. Very well, then. I'll have to fry


you both. Daddy, stop it. Can't


you get through one day without executing someone? Mindy. I told


you to stay in the carriage. Where's


your love and compassion? Look at t
his little guy. He's willing to risk
his life to find


your crown and save
his boss. - But, daughter, I... - Please, Father? At least let
him try. What have


you got to lose? Might I remind


you of


your special problem? - Bald! Bald! Bald! - Bald! - Bald! Bald! - My eyes! All right. Very well, Mindy. I'll give
him a chance. But when


your little champion fails to return, I get to splatter t
his crab all over the walls. And as for


you, be back here with my crown in exactly ten days. - He can
do it in nine. - Eight. - Seven. - Six. - Patrick! - Patrick! Six it is, then. - Five. - Patrick, shush. Until then, the crab shall remain frozen where he now stands. No, wait. I'm begging


you. Who turned on the AC? Mr. Krabs! Oh, no, t
his is terrible. Who's gonna sign my paycheck? Come along, Mindy. Listen,


you guys, the road to Shell City is really dangerous. There's crooks, killers and monsters everywhere. And what's worse, there's a giant Cyclops who guards the outskirts of the city and preys on innocent sea creatures. Don't let
him catch


you, because if he
does, he'll take


you back to
his lair, and


you'll never be seen again. She's purty, SpongeBob. Here, take t
his. What's in here? It's a magical bag of winds. - I stole them from my father. - You're hot. Once


you find the crown, open the bag of winds and


you'll be blown back home. - Mindy! - I'm coming. - Good luck, SpongeBob. - Wait. How did


you know my name? Oh, I'm gonna be queen of the sea one day. I've learned the names of all the sea creatures. What's my name? That's easy. You're Patrick Star. - Mindy! - I gotta go. I believe in


you guys. Thanks, Mindy. Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. Patrick, Squidward and I... Pass. - Patrick and I... - Hi. ...

are gonna get that crown back and save


you from Neptune's wrath. You've got not
hing to worry about. Your life is in our hands. Patrick, let's go get that crown. - Feast


your eyes, Patrick. - What is it? The Patty Wagon. Mr. Krabs uses it for promotional reasons. Let me show


you some of its features. Sesame-seed finish, steel-belted pickles, grilled-leather interior. And under the hood, a fuel-injected french-fryer with dual overhead grease traps. - Wow. - Yeah, wow. Hey, I thought


you didn't have a driver's license. You
don't need a license to drive a sandwich. - Shell City, here we come! - Shell City, here we come! Ding-a-ling. Hey there, old buddy. Freeze. One secret formula to go,
please. No, no,
don't trouble


yourself. I'll get it. Well, I'd like to hang around, but I've got Krabby Patties to make... ...over at the Chum Bucket. Plan Z, I love


you. Oh, I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah You're a Goofy Goober, yeah We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah Fill her up,
please. What'll it be, fellas, mustard or ketchup? Are they laug
hing at us? No, Patrick, they're laug
hing next to us. Where


you two dumb kids headed, anyway? - Kids? - Now, Patrick. For


your information, we

are not kids, we

are men. And we're off to get King Neptune's crown in Shell City. - Shell City? - Shell City? Ain't that the place that's guarded by a killer Cyclops? That's right. Lloyd, take off


your hat in respect. Respect for the dead! You two dipsticks ain't gonna last ten seconds over the county line. Oh, yeah? We'll see about that. Out of the car, fellas. How many seconds was that? Twelve. - In


your face. - In


your face. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah. Who's the kid now? They're dead. Perch Perkins here with an incredible news flash. Plankton is selling Krabby Patties at the Chum Bucket. How is t
his possible? Let's find out. Step right up. Plenty for everybody. Excuse me, Plankton. Perch Perkins, Bikini Bottom News. - Can I get a minute? - Anyt
hing for


you, Perch. All of Bikini Bottom wants to know, how did


you get the Krabby Patty? Well, Perch, before my dear friend Eugene Krabs was frozen by King Neptune... I'm sorry. He confided in me a secret wish. "Sell the Krabby Patty in my absence at the Chum Bucket," he said. "Don't let the flame
die out. " By the way, act now and


you get a free Chum Bucket bucket helmet with every purchase. Here


you go, Perch. - Thanks. - Bucket helmets for everyone! My helmet! K

aren, baby, I haven't felt t
his giddy since the day


you agreed to be my wife. I never agreed. Evil Plan Z is working perfectly. Not
hing can stop me now. Not
hing except SpongeBob and
his pink friend. My sensors indicate that they're going after the crown. If they make it back, Neptune might discover some fingerprints. Tiny fingerprints. Stubby, tiny fingerprints. Evil Plan Z is way ahead of


you, baby. I've already
hired someone to take c

are of those two. He's a vicious, cold-blooded predator. Sesame seed. Hey, mister. Does that hat take ten gallons? - Going on. - Yeah. Yeah. - Moving on. - Just keep going. Yup. Gonna get that crown. Oh, yeah. - All right. - All right. Yeah. Victory. - Are we there yet? - We must be close by now. Patrick, look. We're
doing great! Shell City's only five days away. By car. I wish we still had our car. SpongeBob, look. Our car! - The key. - Where
do


you t
hink it is? There it is, Pat. The key! Now, how

are we gonna get it? I know. Walk in and ask
him for it. What

are


you looking at? - Patrick, that's a terrible idea. - Sorry. I know. I'll go in and create a distraction, and


you get the key. Wait. I wanna
do the distraction. Okay. I guess it really
doesn't matter who
does the distraction. You see me walking back...? Can I have everybody's attention? I have to use the bathroom. It's right over there. Stupid contacts. Oh, there it is. I better go wash it off. Patrick. You call that a distraction? Well, I had to go to the bathroom. Well, I got my hands dirty for not
hing. Patrick, check it out. - Hooray! - Hooray! - Bubble party! - Bubble party! Hey! Who blew t
his bubble? You all know the rules! All bubble-blowing babies will be beaten senseless by every able-bo
died patron in the bar. That's right! So who blew it? So nobody knows. - Maybe it was... - Shut up! Somebody in here ain't a real man. You! We're on a baby hunt. And
don't t
hink we
don't know how to weed them out. Now, everybody line up. DJ, time for the test. No baby can resist singing along to t
his. SpongeBob, it's the Goofy Goober theme song. I know. Oh, I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah You're a Goofy Goober, yeah We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah - It was


you! You're the baby! - No, no! I only coughed, I
swear. DJ! Turn it up louder! Don't sing along, Patrick. I'm trying. Trying so hard. I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah You're a Goofy Goober, yeah We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah Goofy, goofy, goober, goobers, yeah Well, well, well. W
hich one of


you babies was it? - It was
him. - It was
him. - He did it. - He did it. I've never even eaten at... Goofy, goofy, goober, goobers, yeah Well, looks like we got ourselves a
double baby. Man, that was a close call. Guess what I got. The key! Too bad SpongeBob's not here to enjoy SpongeBob not being here. Morning. Some people have no taste in headgear. Babies too? Excuse me, miss, but where is everybody getting that horrid headwear? Who said that? Down here. Well, I got it at the Chum Bucket. Plankton's giving them away free with every Krabby Patty. Chum Bucket? Free? Krabby Patty? Plankton? Giving? With? So


you're selling Krabby Patties, Plankton? That's right, Squidward. And there's a free bucket helmet with every purchase. C

are for one? No. You may have hoodwinked everyone else in t
his backwater town, but


you can't fool me. I listen to public radio. - And what's that supposed to mean? - It means


you set up Mr. Krabs. You stole the crown so Neptune would freeze
him and


you could finally get


your stubby little paws on the Krabby Patty formula. It was


you all along. But


you made one fatal mistake. You messed with my paycheck. And I'm gonna report


you to the
highest authority in the land, King Neptune! We'll see about that, Inspector Looselips. Now activating helmet brain- control devices. What? All hail Plankton. - What's going on here? - All hail Plankton. Seize
him, slaves! All hail Plankton. I'm getting out of here! All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton. Who can stop me now? Who? - Come on, Pat, one more time. - Okay. We're on a baby hunt. And
don't t
hink we
don't know how to weed them out. "Weed them out. " What a jerk. The road's getting kind of bumpy here. You know, SpongeBob, there's a lesson to be learned from all of t
his. What's that, Patrick? A bubble-blowing
double baby
doesn't belong out here in man's country. Yeah. Wait. We blew that bubble. Doesn't that make us a bubble-blowing
double baby? Hey, look, free ice cream! Oh, boy! How


you
doing? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. SpongeBob! Yeah? Make mine a chocolate! Got


you covered. Two,
please. Certainly. You kids enjoy. Actually, we're men, lady, but thanks. Okay, Patrick, let's... You can let go now. I said, let go,
please. What is t
his? What kind of old lady

are


you? Did


you get the ice cream? Step on it, Patrick! Hey! You may not know it, cowboy, but we got a rule around here about blowing bubbles. All bubble-blowing babies will be beaten senseless by every able-bo
died... - In bar... - Bar... Come on, kid
dies, have some ice cream. I'll let


you pet Mr. W
hiskers. Jump for it, Patrick! Well, we lost our car again. Never mind the car, where's the road? Road. Road. Road. Road. Road. Road. Road. R... Sorry. There's the road. On the other side of t
his... ...deep, dark... ...dangerous... - Hazar
dous. ... hazar
dous... Monster-infested. Yeah, monster-infested... ...trench. Hey, SpongeBob, look! Here's the way
down. Well, we're not gonna get the crown standing here. On to Shell City. Hey, look, it's making noise. SpongeBob? - Hey, where

are


you going? - I'm going home, Patrick. But what about Mr. Krabs? What about us? We'll never survive in that trench! You said it


yourself, t
his is man's country. And let's face it, Pat. We're just... ...kids. - We're not kids. Open


your eyes, Patrick! We blow bubbles, we eat ice cream. We wors
hip a dancing peanut, for corn's sake! We
don't belong out here! We
do not wors
hip
him. You've been wearing the same Goofy Goober Peanut Party underpants for three years straight. What
do


you call that? Wors
hip? You're right, SpongeBob. We

are kids. Pull


your pants up, Patrick. - We're going home. - But


you can't go home. Mindy! Mindy? - How much did


you hear? - I heard enough. - Did


you see my underwear? - No, Patrick. Did


you want to? Look, guys,


you may be kids, but


you're the only ones left who can get that crown. What
do


you mean, the only ones left? T
hings have gotten a lot worse since


you left Bikini Bottom. Or should I say Planktopolis. All hail Plankton. No resting! T
his monument celebrating my glory isn't gonna build itself. Move faster! Oh, my gosh! Patrick, look! Plankton's turned everyone we know into slaves. Squidward. Sandy. Mrs. Puff. Even Gary. Plankton. Can't


your father
do somet
hing? My father's too distracted by
his bald spot to
do anyt
hing. Squire, will


you hurry. So


you see,


you can't quit. The fate of Bikini Bottom rests in


your hands. - But... But we're just... - Hey. It
doesn't matter if


you're kids. And what's so wrong with being a kid, anyway? Kids rule! You
don't need to be a man to
do t
his. You just gotta believe in


yourself. You just gotta believe! - I believe. - That's the spirit. I believe that everybody I know is a goner! Come on, guys. Guys. Guys? Guys? Oh, boy. T
hink, Mindy, t
hink. Yup, I guess


you're right. A couple of kids could never survive t
his journey. That's why I guess I'll just have to turn


you into men. You can
do that? How? With my mermaid magic. Did


you hear that, Patrick? She'll use her mermaid magic to turn us into men! Hooray! We're gonna be men! We're gonna be men! We're gonna be men! Good. Now, let's get started. Close


your eyes. - Are we men yet? - Not yet. Spin around three times. I t
hink it's working. Good. Now, keep


your eyes shut. With my mermaid's magic and my one tailfin, I command the two of


you to turn into men! Open


your eyes. I
don't feel any... Oh, my gosh, Patrick,


you have a mustache! So
do


you! So now that


you're men, can


you make it to Shell City? - Guys. - Yeah? I said, now that


you're men, can


you make it to Shell City? Heck, yeah! - Are men afraid of anyt
hing? - Heck, no! And why? Because we're invincible! - Yeah! - Yeah! I never said that. Yeah. - Patrick? - Yeah, buddy? Why did we jump over the edge instead of taking the stairs? Bec... Well... - Patrick. - Are we dead? No. Far from it, my friend. We're safe and sound at the bottom of t
his trench. The mustaches worked! Do


you know what that means? We

are invincible! Now that we're men We can
do anyt
hing Now that we're men We

Now that they're men We can't bother them Now that they're men They have become our friends Now that they're men There'll be a happy end They'll pass the test And finish the quest for the crown They'll pass the test And finish the quest They'll pass the test And finish the quest for the crown "Shell City, dead ahead. " We did it, Pat! We made it past everyt

are awesome! Well, Patrick, we should be there in one more verse. - Now that we're men... - Finally. I got


you right where I want


you. Can I help


you with somet
hing, sir? Name's Dennis. I've been
hired to exterminate


you. You're gonna exterminate us? Listen, junior,


you caught me and my friend here in a good mood today, so I'm gonna let


you off with a warning. Step aside, and


you won't have to feel the awesome wrath of our mustaches. You mean these? I thought


you still had a piece of salad stuck to


your lip from lunchtime. They were fake? Of course they were fake! T
his is what a real mustache looks like. - Is he a mermaid? - All right. Enough gab. What

are


you gonna
do to us? Plankton was very specific. Plankton? For some reason, he wanted me to step on


you. Step on us? Yeah! That way


you'll never find out that he stole the crown! Perhaps I've said too much. That's a big boot. Don't worry. T
his will only hurt a lot. I love t
his job! - Bigger boot! - Wait, Pat. T
his bigger boot saved our lives. Thank


you, stranger. Stranger? It's the Cyclops! Help us! Help us! Save us, someone! Are we dead? I
don't t
hink so. Artificially colored rocks? I
don't know where we

are. What is t
his? It's some kind of wall of psyc
hic energy. No, Pat, it's a giant glass bowl. Hey, there's some fish folk. - Hey, over here! - Hey! Hey! Hey,


you guys! - You guys, hey! Help! - Hey! Help! - A little help here! We're stuck in t
his... - Help us out of the tank! Wait a second. Those fish

are dead. What's he gonna
do with us? Oh, no, he's going for
his evil instruments of torture. Glue? Google eyes? He's making a humorous diorama of... ...Alexander Clam Bell? Patrick, he's killing sea animals and making them into smelly knickknacks. And I t
hink we're next. - You t
hink so? - Patrick! No! The heat is so intense from t
his lamp that I can't move. Tell me about it. T
his
doesn't look too good, Patrick. You mean we're not gonna Get the crown, save the town And Mr. Krabs? I
don't even t
hink we're gonna be able to save ourselves, buddy. - Thanks. - Don't mention it. Well, it looks like what everybody said about us is true, Patrick. You mean that we're attractive? No, that we're just kids. A couple of kids in way over their heads. We were
doomed from the start. I mean, look at us. We didn't even come close to the crown. We let everybody
down. We failed. Shell City. Yeah, we never made it to Shell City. Shell City. Exactly, buddy. Yeah, the place we never got to. Shell City. Okay, now


you're starting to bum me out, Patrick. No, look at the sign. "Shell City. Marine gifts and sundries. " Shell City is a gift shop? But if t
his is Shell City, then where's the...? - Crown. - Crown. Neptune's crown. T
his is Shell City. Pat, we did make it. Yeah, I guess we did. We did all right for a couple of goofballs. I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah You're a Goofy Goober, yeah We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah That's the end of SpongeBob. Come here,


you. Shut up and look at the screen. The bird's right. Look. It be the tear of the Goofy Goobers. Hey, we're alive. - Let's get that crown. - Right. On three, Patrick. Ready? One, two, three. Hey, it's lighter than I thought. What's happening? I
don't know. Look! Come on, Patrick. Let's get t
his crown back to Bikini Bottom. - Do


you still have that bag of winds? - I sure
do. Here


you go. What? Not
hing. Not
hing. Okay, let's go over the instructions. Let's see, it says here, "Step one: Point bag away from home. " - Okay. - "Step two: Plant feet firmly on ground. " - Right. - "Step three: Remove string from bag, releasing the winds. " Check. Well, that seems simple enough. Point bag away from home, feet firmly on ground, pull string, releasing the winds. All right, let's
do it for real. SpongeBob? - No, no, stop! - I was bad, I'm sorry! - Please, bag. - I'm sorry, I just thought... It was a mistake! Oh, no. How will we ever get back to Bikini Bottom now? I can take


you there. - Who

are


you? - I'm David Hasselhoff. - Hooray! - Hooray! So where's


your boat? Boat? - Go, Hasselhoff. - Next stop, Bikini Bottom. All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton. Well, Krabs,


you know what today is? Sorry about t
his, calendar. March . Wait, that's not right. It should say "The day that Krabs fries. " Guess who's here. Hooray for Hasselhoff! Not
hing can stop us now. Unidentified object off the
hindquarters. It looks like... ...bigger boot. But how? Dennis! Did


you miss me? T
his is the best seat in the house. All right, Neptune, let's get it on. Eugene Krabs,


your six-day reprieve is up, and it is time for


you to
die. Please, I didn't
do it. There is not
hing else I can
do. You can give SpongeBob and Patrick a little more time. Except give SpongeBob and Patrick a little more time... What? Mindy, will


you butt out. I won't have


you stalling t
his execution. Stalling? I'm not stalling anyt
hing. - Yes,


you

are. - No, I'm not. Yes,


you

are. You're
doing it right now. - I'm stalling. - Yes. - Stalling? - Stalling! - Stalling. - Stalling! Oh, boy. Now, where were we? - Patrick, run. - No. I'm tired of running. If we run now, we'll never stop... Run, SpongeBob! Take it easy back there, fellas. SpongeBob, be c

areful. Come on, kid, give it up. Dennis always gets
his man. Never! Yeah! I did it! You got guts, kid. Too bad I gotta rip them out of


you. I
don't know what Plankton's paying


you, but if


you let us go, I can make it worth


your w
hile. It's gonna take a lot more than ... - What is t
his? - That, sir, is five Goober
dollars. Legal tender at any participating Goofy Goober... I got bubbles. Fun at parties. My eyes. I got


you, SpongeBob. Thanks, buddy. Thanks a lot. That's it. I'm through messing around. See


you later, fools. See


you. So


you t
hink... ...I'm... ...stalling. Where am I, in Crazytown? I have had enough of t
his nonsense! You

are to wait in the carriage until the execution is
done. - But, Daddy... - Now! No, no, no! Oh, SpongeBob, wherever


you

are,


you better hurry. Okay, fellas, t
his is where


you get off. Bikini Bottom's directly below. But we'll never be able to float
down in time. Who said anyt
hing about floating? - Initiating launch sequence. - What the...? - Did


you see that? - The control. All hands on deck. Ten seconds to liftoff. Nine, eight... Eugene Krabs, the time has come... - No. - Yes. ...six, five... ...for


you... - No. - Yes. ...three, two... ...to fry. - No. - Yes. - ... one. No! You
done good, Hasselhoff. You
done... Hooray! We made it. We made it. My crown. My beautiful crown! SpongeBob? Patrick? I knew


you could
do it. Oh, yes. Well
done, SpongeBoob. Sorry to rain on


your parade, Plankton. Oh,
don't worry about me. My parade shall be quite dry under my umbrella! Umbrella? Daddy, no. Daddy, yes. All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton. SpongeBob, what happened? - Plankton cheated. - Cheated? Hold on there, baldy. Oh, grow up. What,


you t
hink t
his is a game of kickball on the playground? You never had a chance to defeat me, fool. And


you know why? Because


you cheated? No, not because I cheated. Because I'm an evil genius. And


you're just a kid. A stupid kid. I guess


you're right, Plankton. I am just a kid. Of course I'm right. Okay, Neptune, time to kill. And


you know, I've been through a lot in the past six days, five minutes, -and-a-half seconds. And if I've learned anyt
hing during that time, it's that


you

are who


you

are. - That's right. Okay, Neptune... - And no amount of mermaid magic... ...or managerial promotion... ...or some other t
hird t
hing... ...can make me anyt
hing more than what I really am inside: - A kid. - That's great. - Now, get back against the wall. - But that's okay. - What? What's going on? - Because I did what everyone said a kid couldn't
do. I made it to Shell City, and I beat the Cyclops, and I rode the Hasselhoff, and I brought the crown back. - All right, we get the point. - So, yeah, I'm a kid. And I'm also a goofball. And a wing nut. And a Knucklehead McSpazatron! - What's going on here? - But most of all, I'm... - Okay, settle
down. Take it easy. - I'm... I'm... What the scallop?! I'm a Goofy Goober You're a Goofy Goober We're all Goofy Goobers Goofy, goofy, goober, goober Put


your toys away Well, all I gotta say When


you tell me not to play I say no way - No way! - No, no freaking way I'm a kid,


you say When


you say I'm a kid I say, "Say it again" And then I say thanks - Thanks! - Thank


you very much So if


you're t
hinking That


you'd like to be like me Go ahead and try The kid inside will set


you free I'm a Goofy Goober What's happening? His dance moves

are impressive, but I'm in control. - Seize
him! - All hail Plankton. I'm free. I've been freed! What? No! My precious helmets! His chops

are too righteous. The helmets can't handle t
his level of rock 'n' roll. K

aren,
do somet
hing. K

aren? All right, that's the last straw. Neptune, I command


you to... - Here


you go, Daddy. - I better get out of here. Look, it's the wizard who saved us. Out of my way, fools. Come on, I was just kidding. Come on,


you guys knew that, didn't


you? With the helmets and the big monuments... Wasn't that
hilarious, everybody? I will destroy all of


you! Well, Mindy, I have to admit,


you were right. Your compassion for these sea creatures proved a most admirable trait. Without it, I would have never again seen my beloved crown. I t
hink


you're going to make a fine ruler of the sea one day. - Now, let's go home. - Daddy, haven't


you forgotten somet
hing? What? Oh, yeah. Eugene Krabs, I forgot to unfreeze


you. What the...? I guess I had it set to "real boy" ending. Oh, I'm sorry for falsely freezing


you, Krabs. And may I say, sir,


you

are a very lucky fellow to have in


your employ such a brave, faithful and heroic


young lad. - Where is he, anyway? - I'm up here. I'm on it. Go to
him now, Krabs. Embrace
him. SpongeBob, me boy, I'm sorry I ever
doubted


you. That's a mistake I won't make again. Oh, Mr. Krabs,


you old soft-serve. And now, SpongeBob, I'm gonna
do somet
hing that I should've
done six days ago. Mr. Squidward, front and center,
please. I t
hink we all know who rightfully deserves to wear that manager pin. I couldn't agree more, sir. Hooray for SpongeBob! Wait a second, everybody. There's somet
hing I need to say first. I just
don't know how to put it. I t
hink I know what it is. After going on


your life-changing journey,


you now realize


you
don't want what


you thought


you wanted. What


you really wanted was inside


you all along. Are


you crazy? I was just gonna tell


you that


your fly is
down. Manager! T
his is the greatest day of my life! You know, David Hasselhoff is a great artist. Excuse me, sir. You folks have to leave. What? Say that again, if


you d

are. You folks have to leave. Okay.

I hope


you realise Steve (minecraft) eats an entire c
hicken in a whole 2.76 seconds t
his disturbs me because
A. That is physically impossible
B. That is neurologically impossible
I have also come to the conclusion that he eats the bones as well, w
hich in t
his case is absolutely disgusting because bones

are used to make bone meal. Minecraft why?

Speak for


yourself CUCK. I have two degrees and a 142 IQ. Is also knock


your fucking head off if


you spoke to me like that. The only "dumb as
dog s
hit" person here is


you... You fucking CUCK. I'd suggest watc
hing Trumps speech about Hillary from The other day. We both know


you won't, and I'd be a large portion of my salary that


you've never watched one of
his speeches. You get all


your news from what? CNN? MSNBC? Tyt? Huff post? Tumblr? You're a little s
hit, with a s
hit brain and zero clue what's going on. Get fucked.

I was sharing a passionate kiss with my romantic interest, when my cellular phone alerted me that someone wished to converse with me. The man on the phone inquired as to what I was engaging in with
his daughter. Assuming t
his man was my romantic interest's father, I explained the conversation I had to her. She informed me that her father was deceased. That is when I thought to myself "If her father is dead, then who was conversing with me on the cellular phone?" And then a human skeletal structure appe

Club Penguin is shutting
down on March 29, 2017 supposedly to mark the opening and transition onto their new title called Club Penguin Island, everyt
hing seems innocent enough, right? But what if I told


you t
his has all been planned and set up by the government, more specifically the Clinton Foundation, to stop the massive flow of Clinton critical emails being leaked through a seemingly harmless social game like Club Penguin. When people t
hink back to the original Clinton leaks, everyone points towards Russia and Trump, they're practically
doing it themselves, but what if that's exactly what the Clinton Foundation wants


you to t
hink. Club Penguin is being bought out and shut
down to stop the primary way of communication between government separatists.
Now


you might be asking, "but /u/DaiHappy, whadabout clubb benguin isslan-" and I'll stop


you right there because the answer is obvious, Club Penguin Island, if what they're calling it, is going to be a heavily government monitored game designed strategically to catch and neutralize Anti-Clinton radicals. W
hile we sit here and sulk over a petty game being shut
down, remember t
his, Hillary is probably beating a poor puppy to death with a dil
do as we speak, we

are too blind and stupid to realize how to stop it. It's time to open


your eyes people, Hillary didn't lose, Hillary will come back, enjoy


your last breath of fresh air because in 2020 it will be us who Hillary beats to death with a dil
do.

What the fuck did


you just say about me,


you little heretic? I'll have


you know I graduated top of my Order, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on the Saracens, and I have over CCC confirmed kills.
I am trained in religious warf

are, and I'm the top knight in the Pope's army. You

are not
hing to me but just another heathen. I will wipe


you the fuck out with religious fury the likes of w
hich has never been seen before in t
his Holy Land, mark my fucking deus vult.
You t
hink


you can get away with saying that s
hit to me over carrier pigeons? T
hink again, infidel. As we speak I am contacting my secret Order of crusaders across the Holy Land and Jerusalem is being conquered right now so


you better prep

are for the saving of Jerusalem, heretic. The saving that wipes out the pathetic little t
hing


you call


your faith. You're fucking dead, squire. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill


you in over DCC ways, and that's just with my sword sheathed.
Not only am I extensively trained in religious combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Christian army, and I will use it to its fullest extent to wipe


your miserable asinus off the face of the Eastern Mediterranean,


you little stercore. If only


you could have known what holy retribution


your little "clever" religion was about to bring
down on


you, maybe


you would have converted to Christianity.
But


you couldn't,


you didn't, and now


you're paying the price,


you goddamn heathen. I will enact holy fury all over


you and


you will drown in it.
You're fucking dead, heretic.

Did


you actually laugh out loud, or did


you just breathe slightly louder than


you normally
do? Because having access to so much funny stuff on reddit has destroyed my sense of humour and I
don't t
hink I've actually laughed audibly in the past 5 years.

Autism is a
high honor in the tech savvy misc
hievous meme addicted community. Autism isn't a pejorative but a badge of honor and understanding. Anon always aspires to be autistic and not be complacent with globalist s
hill ten
dies. To be autistic is to be part of keks army and to feed off of meme magick. Meme magick surrounds us all. Normies try to control memes and enforce their societal norms on it. T
his angers kek for kek gave us the gift of meme magick to shape the world. When a bunch of autists come together and harness the memes they can
do anyt
hing. When a normie hears Hillary Clinton talk about the dangers of a cartoon frog, she is discredited. But we know, we plan, we meme.

Anne frankly, I did nazi that coming. I literally came here to say t
his but boy, that escalated quickly so to the top with


you! Lost it at 'T
his is why we can't have nice t
hings' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm t
his gem has just won the internet and is
doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and w
hile that was a risky click, t
his post was a 9/10, 11/10 with rice, would read again. I see what


you did there and it feels good man. You're
doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at


your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like


you. You magnificent bastard;


you, sir,

are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how


you

are a redditor for 4 years, t
his checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for t
his cool story, bro. CTRL+F "about tree fiddy" was not disappointed. Wait, why
do I have


you tagged as "NOPE NOPE NOPE"? Nice try,


you monster. You

are now banned from /r/pyongyang What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as "YOU HAD ONE JOB". I can't fap to t
his. No true scotsman could see that t
his relevant XKCD was bad, and


you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see


your cakeday and raise


you a karma train. One
does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. Jet fuel can't melt dank memes, that stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fuzzy little man-peach, 2/10, would not bang. What is t

don't even know how is t

his will get buried but brace


yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When

You subhuman baboon.
You literal nigger.
How d

are


you speak,


you swarthy jungle monkey. How d

are


you open


your big lipped, rim encrusted, menthol cig

arette smelling mouth?
You

are human trash, Diego Tyrone LeShawn de Mara
dona. Universally despised, derided and mocked. Your nationality and skin tone offers no hope to the world that South America can ever prosper. Crawl back in to the Brazilian jungle


you came out of,


you literal orangutan.
I hope


you decide to sail


your grandfathers skip to the Falklands and rape some sheep, as is in the negroes nature. It would still be the w
hitest pussy


you ever had. Give Nigel and Robert a chance for some target practice,


your sole use to the world. Argentinians obsession with a few windswept islands in the Atlantic is
hilarious but sad. Coincidentally its the only worthw
hile contribution Argentina has made to the medical field. The MUH LAS MALVINAS sentiment in the average negro Argentinian is both an early warning sign of autism in c
hildren, and early on set Alzheimer's in adults.
Take


your black hairy fingers off


your keyboard, and never talk about the human species again,


you mockery of our supposed sh

ared ancestor.. No amount of olive oil and wheat flour slabbed on


your face every morning will make


you w
hite. It's about as delusional of an idea as


your daydreams of European heritage.
You nigger.
You make Bolivia look like a beacon of civilisation.
You

are the Baltimore of South America.
Go fertilise the pampas with


you and


your families corpses, its the best


you can hope for in life. For the first time in


your life, nigger,


you have a job making food for beings vastly superior to


yourself. Uruguayan cattle. Coincidentally, it would be the first time an Argentinian "man" provided for a family.
Die, Diego. No one would miss


you. Except for Australian Aboriginals, who now would have no one to make them look good.

I understand that


you're unfunny and unoriginal, and that


you've seen some vaguely japanese s
hit on reddit before where replies with "NANI?" got positive karma.
I realize that I may be speaking to a c

1)T
hink of somet

2)T

3) Anime is a mental disease. Stay away from it.
K, that's all.

Drake is gay dude. He's actually into guys. Furthermore drake is into


you. When


you hear that music? It's drake dicking


you right in the ear. Yeah that's right - drake is fucking


you in the ear. He's for women.


you're a man and listening to
him. He's fucking


you in the ear all right. Stop getting fucked in the ear by drake. That was a poet by me.

I thought fidget spinning was a dumb trend, but then I got mine. I felt the spin, I felt it on my finger, I felt the rush of a good spin. It changed me. I got my spinner ironically, but I was wrong.

What the fuck Target!? What the actual fuck!? You fucking sold me a Peach fucking Snapple without telling me about the full consequences of drinking t
his fucking s
hit?!? Well APPARENTLY Peach Snapple makes


you GAY, but the Target employees WON'T FUCKING TELL YOU THAT before

you t
his fucking gay potion bulls
hit to promote their liberal agenda!! I was t
hirstin' pretty hard last Thursday, and I stopped by my local Target to quench my t
hirst. Me being the innocent little boy I am, I decided to buy a nice Peach Snapple so I wouldn't DIE OF THIRST, but when I went up to the register to buy it the fucking cas
hier DIDN'T TELL ME THAT PEACH FUCKING SNAPPLE MAKES YOU GAY!! I drank the Peach Snapple and now I can't stop sucking dick!! All the cute boys at school won't stop making fun of me, and I can't tell my p

arents because then the boys won't let me suck their dicks anymore!!! so BE WARNED boys, Peach Snapple makes


you gay and Target
doesn't give two s
hits about


your political beliefs or


your HOMOSEXUALITY!!

Can t
his meme fucking
die already? It requires no thought to post, it's not funny, and it was already an ironic t
hing to say in 2008.
Fuck literally everyt
hing about Reddit, constantly encouraging retards to post variations of these same 3 words on every goddamn post they see. You couldn't even bother to come up with replacements for "fake" and "gay", yet for some reason


you're still sitting at the top of the comments.

im like a gamer muslim girl and like evry time i play roblox (its a rreal game shut up) everyone is like "show me ur tits" or "allahu akbar!!" but like i
dont even kno what either of those mean (like wat???) but those arnt even the worst ones like they sometime say t
hing like "go back to isis" like thats very rude like my uncle is in isis and like i already visited
him like a month ago so like why would i go again (like wat????) and like isis is pretty cool actually so like why
do people ahte it?? also like when i play call of duty (im only 12 and my mom
dosnt let me play im such a rebel XDD) ppl tell me to like turn off my voice changr and its like its my real voice how can i change it (like wat??) and lik they aslo say like "trump will kik


you out" but like i support
donald trump so like why would he kick me out (like wat??) anyway like it sucks to be a gamer muslim girl

He always sits back and watches me, and he knows tiny little tidbits about the nations I play. Like the PLC union, or the Iberian wedding. He's even starting to develop a fiery hatred for blue t
hings. Just last week, he bit a man in a blue s
hirt and shouted "BBB!" Sometimes we find
him late at night poking holes in a print-out jpeg of a Turkish flag.
He went to school yesterday and the teacher sent
him home early, because they were talking about Native Americans and they had a writing assignment, so he wrote
down "they

are savegis

are bad."
I need help. How
do I stop t
his? I fear that when he gets old enough to play the game
himself, he will learn tips on how to enact
his twisted fantasies.

Honestly, the United States and Japan

are the two best countries on Earth. Being a weaboo in the states is pretty much the pinnacle of existence. I remember one time after I had been hunting, I was skinning the deer in my barn w
hile watc
hing the sunset over the rolling mountains and playing Azumanga Daioh on my laptop, and I masturbated to Tomo so hard I accudentally knocked over my gun. When I finally came back to my senses post-orgasm I st

ared at my flag and thought "God bless the USA". Those other countries just
don't offer anyt
hing like that, so they
don't matter for anyt
hing beyond selling me oil.

Whenever I masturbate, I
do a lot of foreplay. I write
down "Precum" on a sheet of paper, and stick the pen in my ass. I massage my foreskin and put a grapefruit with the centre hollowed out over my cock until I start leaking. Then I begin the full grapefruiting, stopping when I'm just on the edge. I get on the table, and try to cross out the "pre" on the note with the pen still inside me. The pressure of it being presssed against my prostrate usually causes me to ejaculate all over the note. It reminds myself that I became a better person than before.

There's been an uptick recently in pastas with emojis. Although sometimes funny and creative there

are a lot of submissions with them and they usually get plenty of upvotes. Ever since the "good s
hit" pasta came out there

are submissions with low quality variants posted frequently.
We've received complaints that emojis were flooding the sub and although we
don't want to ban them outright,


your submission could be removed from the sub if it's an emojipasta. We want to give more traditional text pasta a chance at the frontpage. If


your pasta consists of primarly emojis like t
his and t
his, post it to /r/emojipasta.
/r/emojipasta is newer but specializes in these kind of pastas. There's also /r/goods
hitpasta for that good s
hit craving.

Update: As of March 2 we will be removing primarily emojipastas and directly to /r/emojipasta. That sub is now popular enough to catch most of them beforehand. If


you see anyt
hing that
doesn't belong here
please report it.

YOU KNOW THEY SAY ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, BUT YOU LOOK AT ME AND YOU LOOK AT SOMOA JOE AND YOU CAN SEE THAT STATEMENT IS NOT TRUE! SEE NORMALLY IF YOU GO 1 ON 1 WITH ANOTHER WRESTLER YOU GOT A 50/50 CHANCE OF WINNING. BUT I'M A GENETIC FREAK, AND I'M NOT NORMAL! SO YOU GOT A 25% AT BEST AT BEAT ME! AND THEN YOU ADD KURT ANGLE TO THE MIX - YOU THE CHANCES OF WINNING DRASTIC GO DOWN. SEE THE THREE-WAY AT SACRIFICE YOU GOT A 33 AND A 3rd CHANCE OF WINNING. BUT I! I GOT A 66 AND 2/3 CHANCE OF WINNING 'CAUSE KURT ANGLE KNOOOWS HE CAN'T BEAT ME, AND HE'S NOT EVEN GONNA TRY! SO SOMOA JOE, YOU TAKE YOUR 33 AND A THIRD CHANCE, MINUS MY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT CHANCE, AND YOU'VE GOT AN EIGHT AND A THIRD CHANCE OF WINNING AT SACRIFICE. BUT THEN YOU TAKE MY 75 CHANCE OF WINNING (IF WE WAS TO GO 1 ON 1) AND THEN ADD 66 S PERCENTS - I GOT A 141 AND TWO THIRDS CHANCE OF WINNING AT SACRIFICE! SENIOR JOE; THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE, AND THEY SPELL DISASTER FOR YOU, AT SACRIFICE!

Your link
doesn't, well... link for me.
Edit: Nevermind it's working now. It was probably my phone. Anyways, yes I agree.... I would very much like to have a cute Asian girl and a fake bomb. I would probably choose the Asian c
hick first though, because well, frankly, I've never banged an Asian c
hick before. I feel like it would be fun, like the forbidden fruit I guess. Plus, "Asian girl" is probably my most clicked on Pornhub tab after "MILF" and "lesbian".

you! The whole Air Bud Pentology is genius and cinema at its absolute best. The intricate, character driven plots and multi-movie story arches hark back to Charles Dickens. Even the spin-off content, produced mainly to fill in the supposed plot holes of the main movies, were so well made and written with such elegance and verbosity that it makes one wonder if they had been planned from the very beginning. The stressful intra-family dynamics portrayed in the films gives such a poignant parallel to our own human lives. Buddy is constantly struggling to balance
his hectic life as a sports super star, a loving partner to Molly, and as good role model to
his 5 c
hildren. Yet, Buddy's inability to handle all three tasks at once show that he possesses human characteristics. Buddy is a workaholic from a blue collar town, always looking for the next job by w
hich to support
his family, and as a result neglects Molly and the ever-rebellious Bud
dies. The Bud
dies, having little contact with their father,

are constantly forced to act as adults at too


young an age. Being denied their c
hildhood, they become runaway pups and eventually turn to a life of vigilante crime. T
his is over the course of the entire franc
hise that we see Buddy's start as


young blue coll

ared
dog who
hit upon the American Dream, turning into a well-meaning but ill prep

ared father whose unrealistic ideals end up manifesting in
his c
hildren. It's beautiful. But


you
don't get that,
do


you? The series touches upon so many cultural phenomenon w
hich

are synonymous with being a modern day human, but views them through the naive and hopeful eyes of human's closest allies. From the scat
hing religious commentary of Santa Bud
dies (2009) to the critical, honest and honestly surprisingly wide reac
hing look at the modern day gladiators that

are American Foot Ball players in Air Bud: Golden Receiver (1998), it's almost impossible to deny Air Bud's prominent role in the advancement of American culture in the last 20 years. It's fabulous. Genius. Each film a Magnum Opus.
And


you call it a cash grabbing hunk of s
hit? You, who hasn't even seen the main Air Bud Pentology, much less the lesser side works like Monkey Up (2016) or Russel Madness (2015)? Have


you even READ
his Buddy's biography Go Buddy (2012) chronicling
his life and fight with cancer? Thought not. How can


you have an informed opinion on anyt

you
don't even bother to stay informed. Honestly disgraceful, and


you should have withheld

My crush just added me on Facebook, I was so happy, when I clicked on her profile and went into her profile she had so many photos of herself in a bikini, lucky for me I can picture her naked beneath that bikini, so being the man I was, I flopped out my dick and started masturbating to her pics, it only took 5 seconds to cum, I decided to confess my love for her so I took the photo of my mess, sent it to her on messenger and went to sleep hoping that she'll have sex with me at school. The next day, I woke up, got to school and sat with all 7 of my friends who make sex jokes, dark jokes and make fun of feminism, I was the most quiet of the group but whenever I talk I say somet
hing funny, anyways when I sat
down one of my mates Sebastian said "Nice sperm ya sick cunt!' He said, at first I was confused and asked " Your fucking sperm ya sick cunt, ya sent it to ya crush! You're fucked cunt!" My heart sank lower than a bomb ready to explode, all my friends started laug

down my pants then my crush saw my erect man wand then decided to wank it so it can squirt its magic, eventually I came all over my friends table and woke up to find myself all alone in my bedroom, again.

I used to watch Disney cartoons as a c
hild, and I always loved Donald Duck. And I
don't mean he was my favorite character, I mean I loved Donald Duck. Not sexually, of course, as I was around seven years old, but I definitely was fascinated with
him to an unusual degree. I had told my p

arents I wanted to grow up to be a duck, and I would even walk around with my arms at my sides, just like a duck. I would eat bread and crackers as a snack, and would try to swim around in the community pool using just my feet, just like a duck would. Donald was my i
dol, and I wanted to be just like
him. Well, the one obvious shortcoming that I had is that my voice wasn't like a duck's voice. Donald spoke in such a unique way, and surely t
his was the t
hing that I needed to emulate to be more like
him. And then I had a moment of brilliance.
My family's
dog ripped apart one of its toys, and my p

arents asked me to throw the scraps away. Buried in the pile of stuffing and cloth was the squeaker. I put it to my mouth and blew on it, and it made a loud squeaky sound. The light bulb clicked on it my head, and without hesitation I swallowed it. Luckily, but to my dismay, it didn't get lodged in my throat and allow me to talk like a duck. However, I
do remember passing it and seeing it floating in the toilet. When I flushed the squeaker
down the toilet, I felt like I flushed my dreams of being a duck
down with it.

What is so funny about copypasta? Someone put a lot of time in writing out a wall of text, and all


you
do is just copy and paste it? Unbelievable. Freaking unbelievable. It is so fucking disrespectful for the original writter to have
his thoughts repeated over and over just for some kind of sick joke. You fools know the CSU copypasta, right? People chuckle at it because he was "very mad". Well, t
hink about it, motherfucker. What if he WAS very mad? What if he actually had feelings and
his day was ruined? Ever t
hink about it like that? No, of course not. You tools just took
his words over and over and used it for s
hits and giggles. How fucking rude. At t
his point, my 10 page essay on why I t
hink Brawl is ass could be used as a copypasta. That is just fucking wrong on so many levels. I'm not going to write out a copypasta myself, because I
don't want my words to be shat out over and over again. I'm just expressing my thoughts and feelings on the abuse of copypasta. It just needs to fucking stop.

do so out of recognition. The first person to ever upvote dat boi did not
do so because a pre-existing meme format. The first person to ever upvote dat boi upvoted a meme literally pulled from the ether by sheer human creativity and willpower. Dat boi is evidence that humans can st

Hi I am a 13 year old virgin. I have never had sex, I've never been kissed on the lips, and I've never been kissed on the cheek. I want to find a girl who will love me forever.

I want to cuddle her every single night and have sex with her (con

are gay). I want to love her. I want her to love me. I
don't want to be lonely. I know I'll find someone someday. If I find nobody, I will honestly kill myself. I want to be loved. If

you never know what's going to learn through that year.

Seriously? After 20 minutes of getting to choke t
his gorgeous girl with
his cock, two little poots of cum is all he could manage? Pathetic. I registered an account just so I could leave t
his comment in hopes he sees it one day. Fronting like


you're some alpha male, w

do


you give her? Two tiddlywinks of cum? I've never felt so personally offended by porn before. You're a real asshole, pal.

As a Russian and a Jew it is my god given right to punch Nazis. Every day I wake up in the morning and feel the sunlight on my face, and I smile. I go outside and beat the everliving s
hit out of some fascists w
hile taking a stroll to my neighborhood Rite Aid to get some yummy Rainbow Sherbet. After I finish my ice cream, I recline on my favorite park bench and wait for Nazis to pass by so I can knock their teeth out. After a long hard day of nazi-beating, I go home and have a refres
hing glass of Babushka's kompot. I am proud of the fact that I am Russian and Jewish, and that my ethnicity allows me to beat up Nazis.

my mom just said I'm grounded and I'm MAD
Ok so I was smoking the marijuana (if


you know what I mean) when my fucking bitch mom came in and started yelling at me for smoking!!! Naturally I started throwing my piss bottles at her and managed to get some piss in her eyes. I was pretty excited so I gave her the finger. Little did she know that I just used that finger to FINGER my GIRLFRIEND (yeah that's right she's a GIRL). Anyway, app

arently that wasn't "acceptable in t

his is the WORST DAY OF MY ENTIRE LIFE! Now I know what it feels like to be depressed :( Thank God I have all of /b/ be

I just did sex so hard to t
his girl. She was moaning and stuff and i did sex so hard and so good with her. She was all "Please have good sex with me" and I said back "Yeah, I'm going to really sex


you so great lady" and she's like "Thanks". It was so good and so hot and we both loved making a sex on all the positions. At the end I was all "Hey, I'm going to finish sex now" and she said "Yes, that would be nice if


you finished so hard on that towel". I said "Yes" and I finished so hard on the towel. And It was so hot.

People joke and laugh and criticize how a movement embo
died by the phrase "Dicks out for Harambe!" can ever gain momentum and grow into more than a bad joke w
hich is frowned upon. The truth is, "Dicks out for Harambe!" is a battle cry and a revolt against reason, spurring humanity to not only literally but also metaphorically extricate their own phallic objects in a display of carnal animalism. For


you, me, and Harambe alike

are one and the same, animals in t

Everyone still remember very clearly why it is NOT a good idea to piss me off. During a soccer game at my
high school one newish ref d

ared to give me a yellow card for my supposed "violating" tackle. I told
him


you
don't know s
hit about soccer and demanded
his qualification. He refused then I told
him I am not only a soccer player, I am also a ken
do, karate, ju
do, and many more martial arts practitioner. He seemed intimidated and I offered
him a chance to round up the situation.
Then it happened, the dude from the other team who was supposed to be "injured" from my tackle started to berate me. I told the ref to prep

are
his Red Card because now the ground is also going to turn red. I approached the guy face on and he started to back off. Some of
his mates started to come to me to restrain me, a single gl

are from me is enough to send c
hill
down their spine, paralyzing them in fear.
I told
him that since we

are playing soccer, I am not going to use my hand. I said I am going to give


you a free kick, and


your face is the ball. In one swift motion he fell like a giraffe. Squealing in the ground, I did NOT stop. His friends now tried to restrain me. In the end it took eight guys to stop my rampage.
Needless to say the game is cancelled. My mates and the opponents now have a newfound respect for me. I will stand against rule breaker.

Ok so I'm pretty new to t
his whole dating t
hing, theres t
his girl I really like in my math class and I wanted to be her boyfriend, theres these really cool guys in grade 9 and they have sex about five times a day, they say that girls love it when boys show them their penis.
So in my next math class I stole a seat next to her and st

ared at her boobs, I became erection and pulled it out through the fly of my pants, as I was about to tap her on the shoulder so she could see my penis, t
his other girl that has no boobs and is ugly screamed "oh my god!", screaming and pointing at my penis.
I stood up to tell her to shut up and go away, but my penis was still hanging out from my pants, all the class was looking at it, I didn't want them to see my penis because it meant I would have to have sex with everybody in the room. I tried to make t
hings right by swooping over to the girl I like and bringing my penis up to her face close up, t
his made it clear that I wanted her to see my penis and not the rest of the class.
She screamed and tried to stab me with a pen, but she missed and stuck it up my bum, it felt really good, and some weird clear goo shot out from my penis and
hit her in the face, she ran out of the room crying and I got sent to the office.
My penis was caught in my zipper, so I had to leave it hanging out there for a w
hile longer, but then classes ended and everybody entered the hallway, everybody saw my penis, and I now have to have sex with the entire school.
I
don't understand what happen, why

are ufly girls so nosy, and why did the girl I like run away? Is my penis very small, I
do not understand.

Don't


you fucking d

are talking s
hit about Undertale,


you fucking idiot.
You surely

are a crybaby
hippie
hipster hater that likes to s
hit on popular t
hings to be edgy. Guess what, dumbass? Undertale is the best game! And if


you disagree


you

are simply ignorant. I bet


you

are a fucking normie that t
hinks Halo is better. Fuck


you.
I used to be ignorant, too, not much of a gamer until I discovered the glory of Undertale. The characters, the plot, the humor, the gameplay, the music. It was simply perfect. It touched my heart and changed my life...
I've tried other so called "good" games like earthbound, zelda, yume nikki, off, but they all suck, they

are all horrible pieces of s
hit comp

ared to Undertale. Toby Fox is the God of videogames and Undertale is the masterpiece of humanity that all gamers should bow
down to.

Sometimes I'll get my girlfriend a nice big ice cream cone at the McDonald's drive-thru, just like that, then once she leans forward to take a bite, I'll floor the car then slam on the breaks so the entire frozen yogurt castle smashes into her face.
"You little schemer!" she cries out, laug

"Fuck


you, bitch," I'll respond dryly.

Long Side note:  We fucking BLOCKED Disney channel in our house.  Yes, we BLOCKED Disney.  Why?  The shows have become full of bitchy little "fuck


you", attitude loaded - s
hit for brains shows where Mom and Dad

are portrayed as idiots who just want to get in the way of kids havin' fun,
dont'cha know.   I post t
his - still feeling a bit shocked.  I mean, Disney?  Fucking DISNEY?  But our little girl became addicted to the Disney Hanna Montana type shows, they're really compelling, especially to little girls.  And we noted her sass factor went thru the roof when she started watc
hing t
his tripe.  WTF?  Again - I'm still flabbergasted.  So, we did a test and (LIED) and told her the Disney wasn't available on DirecTV for a bit.  Well smack my ass an call me Sally, but removing the Disney "p

arents

are idiots" tripe from her entertainment menu worked.  Worked freaking amazingly well.  So, we thought maybe we're mistaking correlation with causation, so I told my wife I'd enable Disney and not tell her when.  Ok, not
double blind but for home "science" better than just bending over to Walt and
his minoins....
In 4 or 5 days after re-enabling Disney channel my wife took me aside and said "fucking hell honey, PLEASE tell me


you turned Disney back on!".  Yes - I had turned Disney back on..  She was actually relieved.
So to t
his date forward, Disney is 100% blocked out on our DirecTV boxes.  Mind


you folks I'm not a prude, oh fucking hell no.  Our kids go to South Beach every year with Mom and Pop, we're actually quite liberal with life, free
dom, and entertainment content.  But t
his Disney s
hit??? If there were a Satan, he'd be at the forefront of producing t
his tripe bulls
hit.

For me, it's the McC
hicken. The best fast food sandwich. I even ask for extra McC
hicken sauce packets and the staff is so friendly and more than willing to oblige.
One time I asked for McC
hicken sauce packets and they gave me three. I said, "Wow, three for free!" and the nice friendly McDonald's worker laughed and said, "I'm going to call


you 3-for-free!".
Now the staff greets me with "hey it's 3-for-free!" and ALWAYS give me three packets. It's such a fun and cool atmosphere at my local McDonald's restaurant, I go there at least 3 times a week for lunch and a large iced coffee with milk instead of cream, 1-2 times for breakfast on the weekend, and maybe once for dinner when I'm in a rush but want a great meal that is affordable, fast, and can match my daily nutritional needs.
I even dip my fries in McC
hicken sauce, it's delicious! What a great restaurant.

Today on How They Do It : Plumbuses.
Everyone has a plumbus in their home. First they take the dingle bop and they smooth it out with a bunch of schleem. The schleem is then...repurposed for later batches.
They take the dingle bop and they push it through the grumbo, where the fleeb is rubbed against it. It's important that the fleeb is rubbed, becasue the fleeb has all the fleeb juice.
Then, a schlami shows up, and he rubs it...and spits on it.
They cut the fleeb. There's several
hizzards in the way.
The blamfs rub against the chumbles, and the...plubis, and grumbo

are shaved away.
That leaves


you with...a regular old plumbus.

What's t
his


you've said to me, my good friend? Ill have


you know I graduated top of my class in conflict resolution, and Ive been involved in numerous friendly discussions, and I have over 300 confirmed friends. I am trained in polite discussions and I'm the top mediator in the entire neighborhood. You

are worth more to me than just another target. I hope we will come to have a friends
hip never before seen on t
his Earth. Don't


you t
hink


you might be hurting someone's feelings saying that over the internet? T
hink about it, my friend. As we speak I am contacting my good friends across the USA and


your P.O. box is being traced right now so


you better prep

are for the greeting cards, friend. The greeting cards that help


you with


your hate. You should look forward to it, friend. I can be anywhere, anytime for


you, and I can calm


you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my chess set. Not only am I extensively trained in conflict resolution, but I have access to the entire group of my friends and I will use them to their full extent to start our new friends
hip. If only


you could have known what kindness and love


your little comment was about to bring


you, maybe


you would have reached out sooner. But


you couldn't,


you didn't, and now we get to start a new friends
hip,


you unique person. I will give


you gifts and


you might have a hard time keeping up. You're finally living, friend.

Okay, I didn't want it to come to t
his, but I really have no option now other than to just rant. Fuck team Valor. Seriously. Fuck those motherfucking cocksuckkng pokebitches. First of all, their message/goal. "To make our Pokemon strong by battling (fighting). WTF? Pokemon

are supposed to be our companions and friends, and these assfuckers treat them as not
hing more than tools of war and destruction. Like, they t
hink t
his is a fucking game or somet
hing. Second, their actual team members. They're all either:
A. Skateboard punks
B. Weeaboos
C. Actual convicted felons
Or D. All of the above.
Not to mention losers and virgins, but that's already assumed from the other t
hings. And the only friends they have

are other team Valor members. Yeah, that's right, it's basically a giant circle jerk about they're the best, even though they

aren't. God, I just hate how they act like they're better than everyone else, just because of a fictional team in a video game. It really gets on my fucking nerves. Just a bunch of c
hildren taking a game too seriously. And
don't even get me started on team Instinct. In fact, they're so irrelevant that I'm not even going to rant about them. Anyway, thanks for letting me get that out, I really needed it. Team Mystic for life.

I
don't t
hink YOU should been heard from/seen. I also dislike


you immensely. That dumb dips
hit statement was incredibly stupid, as

are


you. I t
hink everyone lost some intelligence by taking their time to read that s
hit without responding. You

are an ignorant adult that is unaw

are of the


youth oppression that is occurring in society right now. Now go stand in a corner and cry as


you t
hink about how these

are all true. The truth hurts,
doesn't it, bitch? You got owned by a c
hild.

Every day my erections gets harder, my sessions get longer, and my loads get larger. I feel myself becoming more and more attached to the idea of sex to the point where I feel like if I
don't get intimate soon, I will explode. My hands get red from pulling and my arms get tired of moving up and
down. My right arm already has more muscle mass than my left and it is very noticeable. Sometimes I have to take breaks between yanking it to cool off because I exert myself so much. My family is worried because I hardly come out of my room anymore. I used to have one session a day, then it became two, then three, now I'm bordering on four a day. I'm losing sleep because of it. I'm averaging 5-6 hours of sleep a night. My grades and social life

are suffering. Whenever I speak to girls, I imagine scenarios and fantasies in my head. It
doesn't even need to be a hot girl. Any female I lay eyes upon, I t
hink of taking back to my house. My fantasies and fetishes

are expanding. One day it's lingerie, the next it's incest. I
don't know if my fetishes

are wrong or right, and at t
his point I
don't c

are. I just need to be loved.

T
his reminds me of the time I went to McDonalds and I wanted a Shrek toy but all they had was Barbie and so I started crying but then I remembered that Barbie toys have boobies so I got one with my Happy Meal and took it home and then touched my peepee until my yogurt came out and it got on the barbie so I asked my sister to help clean it up because she's a girl and girls like to clean and instead of grabbing paper towels she just licked it off and said it was good so she then licked it off my peepee and my peepee got hard again so 20 minutes later she licked my peepee and more yogurt came out and she swallowed it and so now sometimes she asks for my yogurt because she said it makes her feel good and so now I play with Barbies and my sister joins in too and we have fun

you

are now
done

guys, i just realized that lil uzi vert's "xo tour llif3" is about neon genesis evangelion. more specifically, it's a first person reflection from s
hinji's point of view about
his mental state, and in particular
his deteriorating relations
hips with the other characters, at a very specific point in the show (second half of ep. 23 to the first half of ep. 24 before kaworu shows up). hear me out here.
"phantom that's all red
inside all w
hite"
these lines reflect on
his relations
hip with misato. the "phantom that's all red" line is clearly a reference to misato's car (in the song acting as a synec
doche for misato herself) but the "inside all w
hite" part is more complicated. if


you'll recall, after rei's sacrifice in episode 23, misato tries to comfort s
hinji by making a sexual advance towards
him, and s
hinji recoils away from her. t
his is subtle and easy to miss, but it represents a huge change in the way s
hinji views misato. prior to t
his moment, misato had been somet
hing of a replacement guardian for s
hinji, but when he is forced to see her in a sexual manner, that image shatters and he can no longer feel comfortable around her. w
hite is the color of semen, therefore in the line "inside all w
hite" the color w
hite symbolizes
his altered view of misato after being subject to her sexual advances.
"my brittany got mad
i'm b

arely her man now"
these lines refer to asuka, the closest t
hing s
hinji has to a "girlfriend" in the show. asuka is, as


you know, an extremely abrasive person, but there were implications that s
hinji may have been able to break
down her walls and their relations
hip could have advanced. however, due to the trauma asuka experiences in episode 22, in w
hich all of her deep-seated insecurities were dragged up to the surface of her mind (and also probably due to undiagnosed borderline personality disorder), she becomes even more defensive and guarded. she is especially furious with s
hinji, in whom she sees her own weakness, and projects her intense self-loat
hing onto
him, ruining any chance of them forming a relations
hip, hence "i'm b

arely her man now".
"everybody got the same swag now
watch the way that i tear it
down"
these lines

are about the incident between s
hinji and toji. in episode 17, toji is selected to be the fourth c
hild, meaning that, since they

are both nerv pilots, he and s
hinji have "the same swag". however, when an angel
hijacks toji's eva and s
hinji refuses to destroy it, gen
do inserts a dummy system to
do the task instead, and s
hinji is forced to "watch the way that [he] tears it
down." as a result, toji is horribly crippled, and s
hinji's guilt over the incident accelerates
his
downward spiral.
"shoulda saw the way she looked me in my eye
she said 'baby, i am not afraid to
die'"
these lines refer to rei's sacrifice in episode 23. rei is essentially a soulless husk created by nerv for the purpose of the instrumentality project, and as such, she has absolutely no qualms about throwing her life away. to s
hinji, however, she is a complex and fully realized person, and he feels a connection with her to some extent. that connection is shattered, though, when he meets rei iii, who, despite having the same appearance as the rei he thought he knew, is a completely stranger to
him. at t
his moment, s
hinji realizes that he never really knew rei at all, and
his loneliness is intensified.
"all my friends

are dead
push me to the edge"
finally, t
his simple refrain reinforces that the disintegration of all s
hinji's relations
hips is causing
him to sink deeper and deeper into the emotional anguish that will go on to kickstart the t
hird impact.
so there


you have it, a full analysis of how "xo tour llif3" is about neon genesis evangelion. feel free to ask questions if


you have any

I've been collecting these for a w
hile and have about 60-80 currently. Since KYM sucks, here is a short writeup about the infamous pasta.
T
his is the original.

What the fuck did


you just fucking say about me,

are not

you the fuck out with precision the likes of w

hink


you can get away with saying that s
hit to me over the Internet? T
hink again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and


your IP is being traced right now so


you better prep

are for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little t
hing


you call


your life. Youre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill


you in over seven hundred ways, and thats just with my b

are hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe


your miserable ass off the face of the continent,


you little s
hit. If only


you could have known what unholy retribution


your little clever comment was about to bring
down upon


you, maybe


you would have held


your fucking tongue. But


you couldnt,


you didnt, and now


youre paying the price,


you goddamn idiot. I will s
hit fury all over


you and


you will drown in it. Youre fucking dead, kid
do.

W
hich came from OperatorChan's copypasta board back in 2010. OP made a thread recently remarking on how today was the happiest day of
his life because they made the pasta about 2 years ago. Here is a link to one of the earliest uses from 4chan's /jp/ board (now arc
hived). The subsequent reply confirms the source. There is also another aside comment on how the pasta wouldn't go anywhere because it was way too long. It was later posted on other boards and quickly picked up steam from there.
It is believed that the ancestor to t
his pasta seems to be t
his one w
hich was posted on /a/ around 2009, a year before t
his version took off. Other posts from the arc
hive confirm the dates. (NSFW)
I'll be posting the variations via comments. Feel free to contribute if


you have any that I'm missing. Some of them have Unknown on them. If


you know what version or perspective they

are from,
please comment.
I also have responses to the pasta: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 9.1 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
I will continue to update t

T

his trap like the pawn she is.
T
his is not an average man


you're dealing with here. Make no mistake, t
his is a genius beyond

Now that he has a full mental blueprint of

him. Expect somet

Mark my words, the lion has been let out of the cage, and he's hungry tonight. So go now, retreat to

hard to not take my mom for granted considering she takes me for granted. my p

My eyes

are literally bloodshot red from crying for the last hour, and I just threw up from the stress. I can't believe we lost again. The president sexually assaults people, the Republican in Montana bodyslams people, and t
his bitch in Georgia refuses to let women with breast cancer get treatment. And the worst part is people still vote for them! It's happening. We

are in 1930s Nazi Germany. We must resist.

Let's start with logic t
hinking.  We will apply these questions to a trap, and it will help determine if they

are gay.
Does the person have a masculine penis? No, they have a feminine penis.
Is the person a man? No, they

are called dickgirls for a reason.
Does a man have a numerical value of 1? No, not only is that not the case, but a man (or a woman) has no numerical value. T
his is nonsense.
Is it gay to be fucked by a girl? No, if t
his was the case then all heterosexual sex would in fact be homosexual in nature.
Suffice to say, I t
hink we can all agree that traps

are not gay using quick and easy logic t
hinking.
Now, we will use imagination t
hinking to imagine a situation in w
hich


you

are having sexual intercourse with a trap.

Ok, so like imagine t
his c
hick; but she's t
his totally fucking SMOKING hot c
hick, and she's got really sexy titties and a sexy butthole that


you can pound and a sexy little feminine penis


you can stroke and suck.

Did that feel gay? I thought not.
We have used both of the types of t
hinking to solve the mystery of if traps

are gay.  They

are not.  I have used indisputable science techniques to skip the hypothesis completely and go straight to a proof.  Science t
hinking is a secret t
hird type of t
hinking that many people
don't have so t
his may be a difficult concept to grasp for some.
I am happy to explain my theorem further and am opening t
his thread to discussion.

I sexually identify as a Navy Seal. Ever since I was a c
hild I dreamed of being the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. People say to me that having over 300 confirmed kills is impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I
don't c

are, I'm beautiful. I'm having a secret network of spies trace


your IP right now so


you better prep

are for the storm, maggot. From now on,


you're fucking dead, kid
do. If


you can't accept me


you need to check


your gorilla privilege. Thank


you for being so understanding.

My teacher said to my I'm a failure, that I'll never amount to anyt
hing. I scoffed at
him. Shocked, my teacher asked what's so funny, my future is on the line. "Well...


you see professor" I say as the teacher prep

ares to laugh at my answer, rebuttal at hand. "I watch Idubbbz." The class is shocked, they merely watch pleb Youtubers like Leafy to feign intelligence, not grasping the humor. "...how? I can't even understand it's sheer nuance and subtlety." "Well


you see...I'M GAAY!" One lone student laughs in the back, I turn to see a who t
his fellow genius is. It's none other than Keemstar.

Is having daughters the ultimate cuckoldry?
I cannot t
hink or comprehend of anyt
hing more cucked than having a daughter. Honestly, t
hink about it rationally. You

are feeding, clot
hing, raising and rearing a girl for at least 18 years solely so she can go and get ravaged by another man. All the hard work


you put into


your beautiful little girl - reading her stories at bedtime, making her go to sports practice, making sure she had a healthy
diet, educating her, playing with her. All of it has one simple result: her body is more enjoyable for the men that will eventually fuck her in every hole.
Raised the perfect girl? Great. Who benefits? If


you're lucky, a ran
dom man who had not
hing to
do with the way she grew up, who marries her. He gets to fuck her tight pussy every night. He gets the benefits of her kind and sweet personality that came from the way


you raised her.
As a man who has a daughter,


you

are LITERALLY dedicating at least 20 years of


your life simply to raise a girl for another man to enjoy. It is the ULTIMATE AND FINAL cuck. T
hink about it logically

Has anyone noticed somet
hing wrong with Cummybot recently? He's gone a bit... Weird. Seriously, somebody go fix
him
please. He's becoming a Dummybot.

Nerds

are over rated and deserve to be bullied.
Quite frankly, I find it
hilarious how girls and


young women seem to be wet for nerds, even fictional ones. Like, of all the men there

are in the world,


you choose nerds? Why? Are


you that insecure about


yourself


you have to go for crap?
Contrary to what nerds try to brainwash


you into believing, they
don't land decent jobs at all. They're often too introverted or rigid to be CEO's or bosses. I know a guy who matches literally the exact stereotype of a nerd, he even wears horn rimmed glasses and a bowtie. He went to University to get a degree in P
hilosophy. Like seriously? Wow dude,


you're so smart, I'm sure a degree in P
hilosophy is truly going to land


you a great job and


you will change the world!
Also, nerds

aren't really smart to begin with. Oh, look, t
his guy's nerdy acting and he's good at math! He's so smart! Except he's not. I suck at math but I'm smart because I know how to deal with people and put them in their place, and I use creative and abstract t
hinking. THAT is the kinda stuff that gets


you somewhere.
Besides with the fact that nerds just act so.. well 'nerdy' and cringy all the time, it makes ME uncomfortable and it's disrespectful to other people by making them uncomfortable. I remember being in
highschool and I'd make friends with everyone, except for nerds. They just ended up taking me for granted and basically hated my guts because I wasn't some robotic person with a rigid mentality. Then they make excuses and say people hate them because of their 'knowledge'. Like quit making excuses some very intelligent people

are well liked, nerd and intelligent

aren't always the same t
hing.
Nerds

are not 'cute', nerds

aren't 'sweet' and they're not even that intelligent. You might as well date a methhead. At least the methhead might have some creative thoughts and not act like a friggen awkward robot. I have trouble even believing nerds

are people.
Also, most serial killers

are nerds so good luck getting killed in some extremely weird way such as having holes drilled in


your head or ending up in a nerd's stomach. I love me some serial killer
documentaries!

Slavs(fake w
hite people), were a race that originated deep underground. Slavs had mystical squatting powers, and very
high alcohol tolerance. They drilled out of the surface 10,000 years ago, and lived among humans.
They scammed their way to the bottom of society, and isolated themselves from their allies. Pilsudski, the rebellious slav, taught independence from Russia, and rejected CSGO spammers. He used
his mystical slav magic channeled from Ivan the Terrible
himself to perform miracles. New slavs became poles, and old slavs stayed slavs.
They have no ideology except to get to the liquor store, w
hich they failed, as the finns have already surpassed them, so they used finns, like Mannerheim and Schaumann to buy vodka  and use it for their own purposes.
They failed that too, and now a german (trump) is president. Germans

are a species that also originated deep underground like Slavs. The slavs were allies with the Germans, and that is why slavs love trump. Trump's real name is Drumpf, a common german last name. Slavs called
him that to try to expose
him as a German, but no one else besides the slavs know about Germans

Ok, 'tis be ABSOLUTE fuckin' bulls
hit. I went to spy wit' ye eye Cars in th' theater yesterday, 'n when Lightnin' McQueen got steamin' wit' Sally in Radiator Sprin's, me boner engaged. When Lightnin' McQueen said "Ka-Chow!", I couldn't help it!!! I closed me eyes, 'n I TORE me dick to shreds, usin' w
hip like motions 'n pulled wit' great force. That was one 'o th' best nuts I ever had, just t
hinkin' 'bout it now gets me riled up. T
hin' be, I nutted all over th' lad
die sittin' right next to me, 'n
his mom got all pissed at me, screamin' at me fer jackin' off on her son. I told that scallywag to shut th' muck up, 'n that jackin' off be a natural, artistic, 'n beautiful process. ye BE grog-filled that me semen be all over ye son, maybe he can learn a lesson or a pair 'bout th' culture 'n art 'o jackin' off. HOWEVER, th' movie theater managers didn't agree wit' me. They KICKED ME OUT 'o th' movie theater, 'n I didn't even finish watc
hin' th' Cars movie. Not only THAT, but they made me spit s
hine up me semen after it already dried out 'n solidified on th' seats. THATS TORTURE!! Do ye be knowin' how harrrd it be to spit s
hine semen after its dried out? ye spit s
hine semen after its FRESH out 'o ye cock, not an hour after ye fuckin' nutted. 'tis be a fuckin' OUTRAGE. Do ye really expect me to not w
hip out me cock 'n jack off when i spy wit' ye eye a steamin' sex scene in a movie? Either ban sex scenes in movies, or LET ME jack off in ye theater, assholes.-

I called 1-800-Dominos to order a pizza. Little did I know what an
ordeal awaited me. When I ordered the pizza, I heard numerous ethnic
slurs towards black people being shouted in the background in Spanish.
T
hinking it was probably just racous customers, I proceeded to order a
large pizza and hot wings, I was really hungry. I then waited
patiently for one hour for my pizza to arrive.
At around one hour and
t
hirty minutes, I called and asked what was going on with the pizza.
The


young man on the phone brazenly told me to "C
hill out nigga, yo
pizza will be there soon" When I demanded
his name, he refused to give
it to me, and hung up. I called back and got a different person who

swears he has no idea what happened, and that the pizza would be there
soon. I waited another half hour before finally calling back to
cancel the pizza, hungrier than I have ever been in my life even after
surviving hurricane katrina with no food and water for days. I was
told ok, fine, we will credit


your card, no problem.
I resigned myself
to going to bed hungry, but then when I had
dozed off for like fifteen
minutes, I heard tires screac
hing outside and someone laying on their
horn for what seemed like almost half a minute, waking up all my
neighbors. When I went outside to see if someone was shot or what in
the world was going on, I found none other than the
dominos pizza
delivery driver with my order now a full TWO HOURS and fifteen minutes
late.
The


young man, a latino with no nametag, appe

ared extremely
disheveled and absolutely REEKED of marihuana smoke. He was also
blaring loud
hispanic rap music from
his car, loudly playing lyrics
glorifying rape. I attempted to check the pizza to see if my order was
correct, but the


young man refused to let me touch the boxes until I
signed the credit card slip and "Gave
him an extra somet
hing" When I
threatened to call
his manager he replied "I AM YO MOTHAFU$!@ MANAGER,
BITCH". I could not believe that t
his crazy drug addict was yelling at
me. I became extremely nervous that t
his


young man was going to attack
me physically, but when I finally got the pizza, I found it was NOT
what I ordered, and furthermore, it was stone cold. I mentioned t
his
to the


young man, who then grabbed the pizza box out of my hands and
threw it onto the hood of my neighbor's car, spraying cold pizza sauce
all over
his newly simonized Camaro. "You NIGGERS
don't DESERVE
pizza!" he yelled, brandis
hing an unlit marijuana cig

arette. He then
got in
his car and peeled out, sideswiping one of my across-the-street
neighbor's cars.
I called 1-800
dominos and tried to tell them t
his
story but they said there was not
hing they could
do for me and that I
would have to use the comment form on their website.
I have never felt so degraded by a fast food organization in my life.
Not only did I not get my food, but I spent the rest of the night
cleaning pizza off of my neighbor's Camaro. Previously I ordered from

dominos several times a year, but I am certain that unless some STRONG
action is taken, I will never eat there again. I am also informing
the members of my congregation about t
his grievous injustices
perpetrated against me by
dominos, and we will unite against t
his
racist treatment of a poor old black man who only wanted to eat some
pizza.

There's one t
hing


you should know about me. I'm a black belt in masturbation. I've jerked my gerkin so much over the past 12 years or so, that my grip is now legendary. I once crushed a man's hand just by giving
him a handshake. Every time he uses that hand now, he t
hinks of me, the man who crippled
his hand. And


you, sword in hand, want to challenge me? I can break that sword in half in 3 seconds. You can try, if


you want to. But just know that I can ruin


your life with one swift motion. Well, what's it gonna be punk?

The year is 2120
I've received my pink money from my beautiful and powerful female boss at my pink job so I can go buy some pink food at the pink grocery store.
Jonesing for a fruit salad
Approach a pink employee
"Excuse me where

are the oranges?"
I realized my mistake too late
"I-I mean the pinks, where

are the pinks at? haha"
The pink police arrive almost immediately
"T
his here is the rapist ma'am?"
"Yes, that's
him"
10 years minimum in the absence of green penitentiary for sexual assault
It's okay I guess. Anyt
hing for equality as my mom's once said.

hickens on
his free range farm,

are one color? Fuck that, give me some colorful cocks any day.
Neopenis out.

I smoked the pot once. I went absolutely bats
hit crazy! I couldn't believe it! I found myself driving 2 miles over the speed limit completely safe in my lane to the ne

arest McDonalds... After ordering my Big Mac, large fries and large Chocolate shake. I safely returned home. I watched some Southpark, ate some amazing munc
hies, laughed my ass off and slept like a baby....
I woke up the next morning covered in blood and realized my McDs run had been a bad dream. I actually was driving 100 miles an hour. Jumped a curb and killed two homeless people. I proceeded to toss them in my trunk. Brought them home. Chopped them up and ate em... Damn I really went crazy! I'll never smoke the pot again! It's the devils lettuce!

Just walked outside in my boxer briefs (tight as frick hugging my gluteus maximus and catering to my package nicely), and the
hispanic milf across the street was outside getting groceries out of her car and looked across the street at my physique (I'm 3 weeks into my cut and my striations

are starting to become more app

arent and I'm looking real FREAKING joocy), and she just st

ared for a second because she's never really seen how I look because I always leave the house wearing hoo
dies or sweaters because I
don't really like to show off my body that much (my body is a temple and


you have to earn


your rights to look at the treasure if


you know what I mean), and she just blurts out "NICE A*, YOU LONG DCKD MOTHERFCKER, WHY DON'T YOU COME ON OVER FOR SOME MILFSOUP?". I honestly didn't know how to react, and I had just eaten pop tarts and drank a lot of water, so I just threw up everywhere, tried to run inside and my boxers got caught on a branch sticking out of a bush and ripped them off and then I fell on the ground and started crying. I'm still laying outside on the ground naked because I'm embarrassed to get up. What should I
do?

I was only 16 years old. I loved communism so much, I had all the treatises and propaganda posters. I prayed to Marx every night to thank
him for the dialectical materialism I had been given. "Workers of the world unite," I said, "


you have not
hing to lose but


your chains." My boss hears me, and calls me a tankie. I knew he was jealous of my commitment to the revolution. I called
him a reactionary fascist. He slaps me and sends me to work for a wage. I'm crying now, and I'm alienated from my labor. I lay in my bed, and I'm poor. A warmth is moving towards me. I feel somet
hing touch me. It's Karl Marx. I am so happy. He w
hispers in my ear, "Let the ruling classes tremble at a communist revolution." He grabs me with
his powerful hands and places me on my knees. I am ready. I organize a labor union for Karl Marx. He throws reactionaries into the gulag. It hurts so much, but I
do it for Marx. I take up arms against the bourgeoisie. I want to contribute to the revolution. He roars a mighty roar as he fills my life with class consciousness. My boss walks in. Karl looks
him straight in the eye and says, "From each according to
his abilities, to each according to
his needs." Marx leaves through the win
dow. Workers of the world unite;


you have not
hing to lose but


your chains.

Strolling through college campus unaccompanied as I often
do. Not worried about being harassed or raped because I am a man. See group of


young la
dies struggling to set up a folding table. Two strong women have extended the legs and

are trying to flip the table upright. I approach them uninvited and say hello. One flees, triggered. "let me help with that girls" I easily flip the table upright with... my masculine strength. Now upright, I can see the sign taped to the table top. FEMINIST BAKESALE. I give a low-pitched chuckle with my testosterone privileged vocal cords. "So


you girls have been busy in the kitchen, what did


you bake?" One strong woman stands with a box to rest on the table. Her eyes

are welled with tears at the oppression she is suffering. "C-cupcakes" - "I love cupcakes, let me see what


you have there" I reach my phallic hand over and open the virginal box t
his poor woman is holding. My male gaze objectifies the cupcakes. "Oh those look good. How much?" Another strong woman speaks up, images of Susan B Anthony flash in her head. "They're a
dollar for men because of the corrupt patria--" I stop her short in a textbook case of verbal rape. "That sounds fine. Give me the whole box." I pull out a capitalist paper bill with the image of a Cis W
hite Male Slaveowner on it. The strong woman before me w
himpers in psyc
hic pain as I hand the bill to her, she has been reduced to a slave -- nay -- a commodity. "Thank


you" she says meekly, feeling violated. I give a sensual grunt as I bite into one of the sweet, moist cupcakes. "Mmmm... It was my privilege."

T
his turns my stomach. Just flat out the most offensive game I've ever seen. I can name family members that
died in t
his conflict, wept at the pictures and accounts of the dead and maimed that experienced t
his hell, was taught all the horrors of it from primary school, through my whole life, it's only ever been a symbol of the folly of war, the worst, most black and shameful era of British and European
history. I've been to the actual battlefields and mass graves across Europe, held the minutes silence without fail every rememberence day my entire life, for as long as I could understand the meaning of it. There was no glory in t
his war. No thrilling action or daring
do, no heroes and villains, t
his was mass murder, a scar on the
history of our species, and every single person involved in it was a victim. T
his trailer, the entire concept of t
his game, makes me feel physically sick, and just so fucking angry. How fucking d

are anyone make a game like t
his about the First World War. I
don't know what's worse, the sick fucking emotionless, greedy cunts that would seriously exploit t
his horror of an industrialised massacre, or the ignorant, soulless bastards that will give them money and enjoy it. Anyone involved in t
his, or seriously t
hink of buying t
his, should be ashamed of themselves.

More than 100 stealth egg attacks baffle one Euclid homeowner and police (photos and video) EUCLID, O
hio -- An 85-year-old Euclid man's home has become the target of mysterious egging attacks that began in March 2014 and haven't stopped. The continuous onslaught of eggs has baffled police, neighbors and local government officials who have tried and failed to identify the source of the attacks that have ruined the man's home and kept
his family on edge. "The accuracy is phenomenal," Albert Clemens, Sr. said. "Because almost every time when it's nice weather and they launch five or six of these at a time, they almost invariably
hit the front
door." Clemens green two-story house sits on the corner of Wilmore Avenue and East 210th Street. He and
his wife bought the home as newlyweds about 60 years ago. Though
his wife has since passed away, Clemens still lives there with
his 49-year-old daughter and 51-year-old son. The house has been pelted with eggs several times a week -- sometimes more than once a day -- for the past year. The attacks always happen after dark and last around 10 minutes each. The family has been awoken as late as 2 a.m. by what sounds like the crack of a gunshot against the aluminum siding or front
door. Clemens and police believe the eggs

are being launched from a block or two away. The siding on the front of Clemens' home is destroyed, splattered with dried egg residue that stripped off the paint. Other than a few rogue eggs that
hit nearby homes, no other neighbors have been targeted. "Somebody is deeply, deeply angry at somebody in that household for some reason," Euclid Lt. Mitch Houser said. Winter offered a short respite for the family, as the egging became less frequent during the cold weather. But both Clemens and police anticipate the attacks picking back up as the snow and ice thaw. An unsolved mystery Euclid police have not taken the investigation lightly. They've spent a year
doing undercover stakeouts, canvassing the neighborhood and even sending eggshells for testing. The department's entire community policing unit was dedicated to tracking
down the eggers at one point. Officers respond quickly to every egging call at the home -- w
hich is less than a mile from the police station. Both Clemens and detectives

are at a dead end when it comes to suspects. Clemens had suspicions about a


young man across the street who confronted
him a couple years ago and asked
him to stop calling police about suspicious activity in the neighborhood. Clemens said that he had started calling police more often as he noticed more crime -- mostly suspected drug activity. Another neighbor Clemens suspected was ruled out when officers saw
him standing outside as an attack occurred in the presence of police. Investigators have taken several different approaches to nabbing the eggers, including installing a surveillance camera on the house. Detectives even collected some eggshell samples and tested them in a crime lab. The eggs were traced back to a local Amish farm, but the trail ended there. Clemens says the culprits either have access to a large supply of eggs or

are stealing them from businesses that throw them out when they go bad. Detectives have followed t
his thread, visiting local restaurants and businesses asking about missing eggs. They've also tried collecting fingerprints from eggshells, but Houser said that's an impossible task. When an egg breaks, it releases proteins that destroy DNA. Officers have gone
door to
door questioning neighbors and handing out fliers. Nobody has come forward with any tips. "The person or people who

are
doing it have remained very tight-lipped app

arently," Houser said. "I would imagine it would be hard to keep a secret of somet
hing that had been
done hundreds of times and for nobody to step forward to talk about it." The guilty parties
don't appear to be intimidated by police interest in the case. An officer last year was taking a report when a barrage of eggs was launched at the house. One
hit
him in the foot. Houser said he's never seen t
his level of vandalism in
his 20 years of police work. It's frustrated the whole department, w
hich has dedicated hundreds of hours toward solving the egging mystery. "The man hours put into that investigation were huge and one of the reasons it's so frustrating that we
don't have somebody right now that we can criminally charge," Houser said. The culprits will face charges of felony vandalism and criminal damaging, Houser said. Additional charges could be tacked on if investigators find evidence that the attacks

are a hate crime. The search continues Clemens is waiting until the perpetrators

are caught before he repairs the tarnished siding. His insurance company is refusing to settle a claim until the guilty party is found. He said he used to clean up after each attack, but it became so frequent that he couldn't keep up. Police initially offered a $500 reward for information, but bumped it up to $1,000 after nobody came forward. That money is still up for grabs. "We're not going to let it go," Houser said. "We'll continue to put effort into it until we figure somet
hing out." Despite all the torment, Clemens said he'd never consider moving from
his beloved home. "I like the neighborhood," Clemens said. "I like the city of Euclid. I would live and
die in t
his house -- but it's been kind of a nightm

are."

Hello, everyone! T
his is the LONGEST TEXT EVER! I was inspired by the various other "longest texts ever" on the internet, and I wanted to make my own. So here it is! T
his is going to be a WORLD RECORD! T
his is actually my t
hird attempt at
doing t
his. The first time, I didn't save it. The second time, the Neocities editor crashed. Now I'm writing t
his in Notepad, then copying it into the Neocities editor instead of typing it directly in the Neocities editor to avoid cras
hing. It sucks that my past two attempts

are gone now. Those actually got pretty long. Not the longest, but still pretty long. I hope t
his one won't get lost somehow. Anyways, let's talk about WAFFLES! I like waffles. Waffles

are cool. Waffles is a funny word. There's a Teen Titans Go episode called "Waffles" where the word "Waffles" is said a hundred-somet
hing times. It's pretty annoying. There's also a Teen Titans Go episode about Pig Latin. Don't know what Pig Latin is? It's a language where


you take all the consonants before the first vowel, move them to the end, and add '-ay' to the end. If the word begins with a vowel,


you just add '-way' to the end. For example, "Waffles" becomes "Afflesway". I've been speaking Pig Latin fluently since the fourth grade, so it surprised me when I saw the episode for the first time. I speak Pig Latin with my sister sometimes. It's pretty fun. I like speaking it in public so that everyone around us gets confused. That's never actually happened before, but if it ever
does, 'twill be pretty funny. By the way, "'twill" is a word I invented recently, and it's a contraction of "it will". I really hope it gains popularity in the near future, because "'twill" is WAY more fun than saying "it'll". "It'll" is too boring. Nobody likes boring.

T
his is nowhere near being the longest text ever, but eventually it will be! I might still be writing t
his a decade later, who knows? But right now, it's not very long. But I'll just keep writing until it is the longest! Have


you ever heard the song "Dau Dau" by Awesome Scampis? It's an amazing song. Look it up on YouTube! I play that song all the time around my sister! It drives her crazy, and I love it. Another way I like driving my sister crazy is by speaking my own made up language to her. She hates the languages I make! The only language that we both speak besides English is Pig Latin. I t
hink


you already knew that. Whatever. I t
hink I'm gonna go for now. Bye! Hi, I'm back now. I'm gonna contribute more to t
his soon-to-be giant wall of text. I just realised I have a giant stuffed frog on my bed. I forgot
his name. I'm pretty sure it was somet
hing stupid though. I t
hink it was "FROG" in Morse Code or somet
hing. Morse Code is cool. I know a bit of it, but I'm not very good at it. I'm also not very good at French. I b

arely know anyt
hing in French, and my pronunciation probably sucks. But I'm learning it, at least. I'm also learning Esperanto. It's t
his language that was made up by some guy a long time ago to be the "universal language". A lot of people speak it. I am such a language nerd. Half of t
his text is probably gonna be about languages. But hey, as long as it's long! Ha, get it? As LONG as it's LONG? I'm so funny, right? No, I'm not. I should probably get some sleep. Goodnight! Hello, I'm back again. I basically have only two interests nowadays: languages and furries. What? Oh, sorry, I thought


you knew I was a furry. Haha, oops.

. Anyway, yeah, I'm a furry, but since I'm a


young furry, I can't really
do as much as I would like to
do in the fan
dom. When I'm older, I would like to have a fursuit, go to furry conventions, all that stuff. But for now I can only dream of that. Sorry


you had to deal with me talking about furries, but I'm honestly very desperate for t
his to be the longest text ever. Last night I was watc
hing not
hing but fursuit unboxings. I t
hink I need help. T
his one time, me and my mom were going to go to a furry Christmas party, but we didn't end up going because of the fact that there was alcohol on the premises, and that she didn't wanna have to be a mom dragging her son through a crowd of furries. Both of those reasons were understandable. Okay, hopefully I won't have to talk about furries anymore. I
don't c

are if


you're a furry reading t
his right now, I just
don't wanna have to torture everyone else. I will no longer say the F word throughout the rest of t
his entire text. Of course, by the F word, I mean the one that I just used six times, not the one that


you're probably t
hinking of w
hich I have not used throughout t
his entire text. I just realised that next year will be 2020. That's crazy! It just feels so futuristic! It's also crazy that the 2010s decade is almost over. That decade brought be a lot of memories. In fact, it brought be almost all of my memories. It'll be sad to see it go. I'm gonna work on a series of video lessons for Toki Pona. I'll expain what Toki Pona is after I come back. Bye! I'm back now, and I decided not to
do it on Toki Pona, since many other people have
done Toki Pona video lessons already. I decided to
do it on Viesa, my English code.

. Now, I shall explain what Toki Pona is. Toki Pona is a minimalist constructed language that has only ~120 words! That means


you can learn it very quickly. I reccomend


you learn it! It's pretty fun and easy! Anyway, yeah, I might finish my video about Viesa later. But for now, I'm gonna add more to t
his giant wall of text, because I want it to be the longest! It would be pretty cool to have a world record for the longest text ever. Not sure how famous I'll get from it, but it'll be cool nonetheless. Nonetheless. That's an interesting word. It's a combination of three entire words. That's pretty neat. Also, remember when I said that I said the F word six times throughout t
his text? I actually messed up there. I actually said it ten times (including the plural form). I'm such a liar! I struggled to spell the word "liar" there. I tried spelling it "lyer", then "lier". Then I remembered that it's "liar".

. At least I'm better at spelling than my sister. She's


younger than me, so I guess it's understandable. "Understandable" is a pretty long word. Hey, I wonder what the most common word I've used so far in t
his text is. I checked, and appearantly it's "I", with 59 uses! The word "I" makes up 5% of the words t
his text! I would've thought "the" would be the most common, but "the" is only the second most used word, with 43 uses. "It" is the t
hird most common, followed by "a" and "to". Congrats to those five words! If


you're wondering what the least common word is, well, it's actually a tie between a bunch of words that

are only used once, and I
don't wanna have to list them all here. Remember when I talked about waffles near the beginning of t
his text? Well, I just put some waffles in the toaster, and I got reminded of the very beginnings of t
his longest text ever. Okay, that was literally yesterday, but I
don't c

are. You can't see me right now, but I'm typing with my nose! Okay, I was not able to type the exclamation point with just my nose. I had to use my finger. But still, I typed all of that sentence with my nose! I'm not typing with my nose right now, because it takes too long, and I wanna get t
his text as long as possible quickly. I'm gonna take a break for now! Bye! Hi, I'm back again. My sister is beside me, watc
hing me write in t
his endless wall of text.

. My sister has a new t
hing where she just says the word "poop" nonstop. I
don't really like it. She also eats her own boogers. I'm not joking. She's gross like that. Also, remember when I said I put waffles in the toaster? Well, I forgot about those and I only ate them just now. Now my sister is just saying ran
dom numbers. Now she's saying that they're not ran
dom, they're the numbers being displayed on the microwave. Still, I
don't know why she's
doing that. Now she's making annoying clicking noises. Now she's saying that she's gonna watch Friends on three different devices. Why!?!?! Hi its me
his sister. I'd like to say that all of that is not true. Max wants to make
his own video but i wont let
him because i need my phone for my alarm.POOP POOP POOP POOP LOL IM FUNNY. kjnbh
hisdn
hidfhdfhjsdjksdnjhdfhdfghdfghdfbhdfbcbhnidjsduhchyduhyduhdhcduhduhdcdhcdhjdnjdnhjsdjxnj Hey, I'm back

k. Sorry about my sister. I had to seize control of the LTE from her because she was
doing keymash. Keymash is just effortless. She just went back to school. She comes home from school for her lunch break. I t
hink I'm gonna go again. Bye! Hello, I'm back. Let's comp

are LTE's. T
his one is only 8593 characters long so far. Kenneth Iman's LTE is 21425 characters long. The Flaming-C
hicken LTE (the original) is a whopping 203941 characters long! I t
hink I'll be able to surpass Kenneth Iman's not long from now. But my goal is to surpass the Flaming-C
hicken LTE. Actually, I just figured out that there's an LTE longer than the Flaming-C
hicken LTE. It's Hermnerps LTE, w
hich is only slightly longer than the Flaming-C
hicken LTE, at 230634 characters. My goal is to surpass THAT. Then I'll be the world record holder, I t
hink. But I'll still be writing t
his even after I ac
hieve the world record, of course. One time, I printed an entire copy of the Bee Movie script for no reason. I heard someone else say they had three copies of the Bee Movie script in their backpack, and I got inspired. But I only made one copy because I didn't want to waste THAT much paper. I still wasted quite a bit of paper, though. Now I wanna see how t
his LTE comp

ares to the Bee Movie script. Okay, I checked, and the Bee Movie script is 50753 characters long. Not as long as some of the LTEs I mentioned, but still longer than mine and Kenneth Iman's combined. T
his LTE is getting close to 10000 characters! That means it'll be half the length of Kenneth Iman's LTE. That's pretty exciting. Also, going back to the topic of the Bee Movie Script, I tried to write the entire t
hing out by hand once. But I never finished it, especially since I'm focusing on t
his t
hing now. Maybe I should write t
his LTE out by hand. Nah, I
don't t
hink I will. Yay, we're at 10000 characters! Let's celebrate by talking about MUSIC! Music is cool. That concludes our celebratory discussion about music. Thank


you, and have a good rest

Hi, I'm back now, and I got a book! It's a dictionary for a language called Elefen. It's like Esperanto, but better. Now I can learn Elefen even without internet! That's pretty cool. I will now write somet
hing in Elefen. See if


you can understand it! Here goes: Si tu pote leje esta, tu es merveliosa! Elefen es un lingua multe fresca! Did


you understand that? Maybe


you can't speak Elefen, but


you still understood that because of


your knowledge of other languages. Elefen is cool because it's an actual language, not an English code like Pig Latin or Viesa. Oh, I forgot to mention that my sister is back from school. She's blasting Rhett and Link songs right now. Have


you seen that picture of Rhett and Link standing with a bunch of ***? Sorry, I almost said the F word there. That would've broken my rule of not saying the F word. I wrote somet
hing in Elefen, so I will also write somet
hing in Toki Pona. See if


you can understand it now! sina sona e toki mi la sina pona mute a! I can speak Toki Pona fluently, by the way. It's also a pretty cool language. My sister is still playing annoying songs. It's
hindering my focus right now. But it's fiiiiine. Okay, luckily she's run out of songs to play. At least for now. She's trying to t
hink of another annoying song to play. Now she's playing a song by Green Day. Not NEARLY as bad as the other songs she just played. I should go for now. Goodbye! Hello, I'm back

You swine. You vulgar little maggot. You worthless bag of filth. As they say in Texas. I’ll bet


you couldn’t pour !@#$ out of a boot with instructions on the heel. You

are a canker. A sore that won’t go away. I would rather kiss a lawyer than be seen with


you.
You’re a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You

are a spineless little worm deserving not
hing but the profoundest contempt. You

are a jerk, a cad, a weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You

are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.
You

are a bleating foal, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf sme

ared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying


your alleged birth into t
his world. An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody, aban
doned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired


you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had
done.
I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as


you. You

are a monster, an ogre, a malformation. I barf at the very thought of


you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid


you. You

are vile, worthless, less than not
hing. You

are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of t
his earth. And did I mention


you smell?
Try to edit


your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with


your insight. The evidence that


you

are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly.
You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick


you up, drive its beak into


your brain, and upon finding it rancid set


you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of


your ignoble blood. May


you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of


your own trite, foolish beliefs.
You

are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You

are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You

are foul and disgusting. You’re a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look
down on


you. Even sheep won’t have sex with


you. You

are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.
And what meaning
do


you expect


your delusional self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us? What fantasy
do


you hold that


you would believe that


your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake?
You

are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You

are ridiculous and obnoxious. You

are the moral[size] equivalent of a leech. You

are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You

are sour and senile. You

are a disease,


you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meat slapper.
On a good day


you’re a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You

are deficient
in all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You

are dank and filthy. You

are asinine and benighted. You

are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever


you go.
You smarmy lager lout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock. You grotty wanking oink artless base-court apple-john. You clouted boggish foot-licking twit. You dankish clack-dish plonker. You gormless crook-pated tosser. You churlish boil-brained clotpole ponce. You cockered bum-bailey poofter. You craven dewberry pisshead cockup pratting naff. You gob-kissing gleeking flap-mouthed coxcomb. You dread-bolted
fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill.
You

are a fiend and a coward, and


you have bad breath. You

are degenerate,
noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing


you exist. I despise everyt
hing about


you, and I wish


you would go away.
I cannot believe how incredibly stupid


you

are. I mean rock-hard stupid.
Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You

are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid.
You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Not
hing in our universe can really be t
his stupid. Perhaps t
his is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anyt
hing else as to be beyond
the laws of physics that we know. I’m sorry. I can’t go on. T
his is an epiphany of stupid for me. After t
his,


you may not hear from me again for a w
hile. I
don’t have enough strength left to deride


your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of t
his drivel. Duh.
The only t
hing worse than


your logic is


your manners. I have snipped away most of what


you wrote, because, well... it didn’t really say anyt
hing. Your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective... Maybe later in life, after


you have learned to read, write, spell, and count,


you will have more success.
True, these

are rudimentary skills that many of us ”normal” people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there

are ”challenged” persons in t
his world who find these t
hings more difficult. If I had known that t
his was


your case then I would have never read


your post. It just wouldn’t have been ”right”.
Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish


you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on


you.

Once taken place in a terribly dreadful time, there was a small cat-licking bird that lived on a not-so-big lane by my house whose name was Charles just like every other soul, male or female, that lived on my smelly, stinky, orange , old, rotten, messy, busted cul-de-sac between Belmont and Rose which
are both awfully gay Streets Like North street or some shit that reminds me of a celebrity like Paris Hilton or some blonde loser that
doesn't even know the capital of her own country, which is the United States of America aka: The U.S.A which is a pristine nation of beauty, opposing to a country as the country of Somalia and Belgium, a part of Europe, which
doesn't even have a government, it's just in a complete state of anarchy just like my mind and soul which
are both filled with outrageous nonsense that I'm typing
down right now into some fat long sentence that probably makes no sense but who c
ares I'm trying to set some sort of weird record here like most ducks snorted or some weird thing like that and if I
do set some sort of record I will be in the Guinness Book of chimkin nungets World Records (though anti-American and pro-European, a place of pitty and despair as Somalia is) which was always my dream because that book has a whole bunch a cool and weird stuff in it and I would Become famous and add to the weirdness of the book like some of their records which reminds me of the Rob & Big where Rob sets all of those skateboarding Records And Big Black eats bananas and
donuts and three weeks later they both get plaques saying the record they set and I want to get one of those so that's why I'm writing all of this stuff
down without ever using a period or some other sentence ending mark like an exclamation point or a question mark or any other symbol that could possibly end my streak of words that is really long now and would take me a while to count just like counting sheep which is supposed to put

you to sleep but it really keeps

you awake because

you want to keep counting and counting until

you
don't know what comes after trillions, but that would take Years or something because it would take a while just to count a trillion seconds or minutes would be even worse just like how ducks
are worse that geese because they
are more aggressive around their

young unlike great white sharks which
are often eaten by their mothers when they
are born and the ones who
do make it out alive have no mother to teach them how to hunt or whatever because none of that matters because us human beings have mothers unless they die or run off with some CEO of a big company or someone else who makes a lot of money and then they leave

you with

your dad and

you
are jealous of

your friends if

you have any because they have moms and

you
don't because

your mom was some greedy pig who wanted money but ended up only getting the money part and she bought drugs because she was depressed and ended up killing herself from an over
dose and

you wouldn't even know about it until

you become some rich person and check the files somewhere and learn that she died of a over
dose and

you eyes get all teary and then

you start crying because

you know that

you wouldn't be alive without that woman

you called mom and I just found out right now that the longest sentence is like 10,000 words so I have a ways to go and

you have to go with me so let's go to 6th gear and throw out some words like Emphysema which I had to
do a report on in 4th grade because we had a ton of projects and this was the disease one and we chose diseases out of a hat and I came out with Emphysema which is a form of lung cancer which is 98% caused by smoking which reminds me of the way my dad describes smoking: "

you get plant leaves, wrap them in paper, light it on fire and suck on it" which is normally a sentence but not today because I'm setting out on the quest for a long sentence that I'm typing up which reminds me of a story my grandpa told me about himself when he was "

your age" about how they covered the letters on the type writers and they had to type so that they could memorize where the letters
are on a type writer and my grandpa says he will never regret taking that class because it helped him out a lot when it came to typing and now a days he is not bad a typing at all because He is almost as fast as me because I am a pretty fast typer and writing this article isn't taking very long and expect being pretty far pretty soon at the pace I'm going right now so there
are going to be some serious records getting busted when I'm finally finished writing this article on this dumb website which will probably end up huffing this article even though it is fun-packed and joyful and keeps the reader reading when they use that excuse to mom saying "just one more sentence" but that sentence is 10,000 words long and still continuing to go at a reasonable pace and it is going to shatter most of those long sentence records just like how the chargers
are going to shatter the most consecutive years without a super bowl win record and I
doubt that they will win one in the near future but they patriots
are going to win some serious super bowls because they
are the best team ever even better than the cowboys or 49ers and no one c
ares a bout them so go patriots and boo chargers even though I live in San Diego and Like the Padres I hate the Chargers because they
are bad and the padres
are bad too but I
don't c
are because they
are my favorite team and the
dodgers
are my least favorite along with the Yankees because the Yankees get a lot of money to spend and the padres and marlins get almost nothing and then the Yankees buy a-rod for a lot and the Rays get almost no money but
are still fighting for first place this season without expensive players like Derek Jeter or a-rod or Johnny Damon or whoever because they
are an all around better team that can beat the Yankees even though the Yankees can beat the royals a lot who really suck because they suck more that the padres
do and so
do the mariners and Rockies even thought the Rockies went to the world series last year they lost and haven't stopped losing for a while now, either and they
are last place in the NL west and that is where the padres used to be but they started hitting home runs and winning games and
are
dong pretty good right now despite having little offense except for Adrian Gonzalez who is leading the NL in RBI's even though he is on the team who scores the least runs in the league but they
are not last in homeruns though they
are like 5 away or something but I’m not sure so screw that and let's talk about something fun like water or food or dirt or something but I think food is the best because their is a lot of things to talk about with food like

you r favorite food which mine happens to be some spicy burrito form Chipotle mexican grill and it is very good just like this macaroni my mom made one time that had bread crumbs on top and it was very good like all of the food they serve on top chef which I wish I could be a judge for because they have a lot of good food on that show and it makes my mouth water whenever I watch it and that is why I watch it because the food is totally awesome and sometimes I hate the people but they end up getting eliminated like the Dance crews in France's Best Dance Crew which is a great show and

you should watch it because people
do good dancing like the JFrabbawockeez because they won the first season and they
are very good just like supreme soul and So real crew and phresh select and super cr3w and I’m only at 1500 words right now so I have to write some serious stuff like a life biography about myself and anything I’ve ever
done which includes going to big bear to ski, fishing, breathing, swimming, going, farting, eating, sleeping and a whole lot more stuff which reminds me of 4th grade again when my teacher was debating with the class whether "a lot" was one or two words and all of the kids including myself said one while the teacher said two and he was right and we were wrong but no one c
ared because we all had fun arguing about and I have fun arguing with my friends about football and not baseball because in baseball we all like the same team but in football I like the patriots and my friends like the chargers and the 49ers and the eagles and the saints but my team always woops their team's ass and they say that the patriots "cheat" and that's how they won even though the patriots just pwned their team and they suck and my team is good but we all agree when it comes to baseball because we all like the padres and we never really argue over anything in baseball which is my favorite sport and I play it and I am good a it and I want it to be my profession but I
doubt that that will happen so my backup plan is being a cop because

you get all of the benefits and

you get paid after

you retire which is good news and I would also like to be some government dude or something like that because they get the benefits too so it would be cool to work for the government which reminds me that my principal worked at the white house and taught the president email because he was the computer guy or something like that so h knows a whole bunch of computer crap like my dad and he is fat too so everyone makes fun of him and I think he huffs kittens too but I am not sure and about that and what the hell is up with all the noob and kitten huffing on this gay ass website like all of the things like "the writer may have been huffing kittens" and stuff like that it really annoys the hell out of me just like other things such as when people clip their finger nails it makes that weird noise that get me all crazy and I hate it just like how me friend hates the sound of chalk on a chalkboard which I find soothing and relaxing but he gets really annoyed and psyched out and he is also very pale-skinned and so is the rest of his family so it must have been some genetic thing like twins and clones and whole bunch of other confusing science crap that I learned a long time ago in 7th grade or something which was when we watched movies in class like UHF which has "Weird Al" Yankovic in it and it is very funny because "Weird Al" Yankovic has to save a TV station with a whole bunch of weird shows like wheel of fish and rauls wild king
dom with a whole bunch of cool animals like flamingos and turtles and stuff like that but who c
ares lets get to the meaty part of this article which is the part where I write the longest word known to man which is Methionylthreonylthreonyl...isoleucine which is cut out because it has 189,819 words so Wikipedia had to cut out the middle part and the longest word is the name of a protein which is the largest known to man to so big names go to big things is app
arently the moral of this story ladies and gentleman the road
doesn't stop here and I have to continue no matter what

you say or think so I should just write some story now that has no periods so lets start with a guy named Carl who liked fish and women and he went to Clara’s house and they had a good food but that isn't enough of a story to set the record so I think I’ll just stick to writing ran
dom crap which really makes no sense at all and here is some ran
dom picture that shows a guy who has two legs and another guy who has three who is mocking the guy with two legs because he rips his flesh in disgust every night and

you think about who would be dumb enough to rip their flesh instead of cut the ring off or something that
doesn't involve entirely gruesome crap like that and I have another life after this one just like how cats have 9 lives I have three because I’m on my second one right now and it is great and

you might think I’m a whole new person but

you
are thinking wrong it's just when I died I came back t life and next time I die I’ll come back to life again and then when I die I’ll be dead for sure which reminds me of Stephen king's book called pet sematary which is coo because people come back to life because there was a burial ground that bring people back to life if they
are dead and that book is a great book and

you should read it along with the Harry Potter series which has magic in it and it is cool too so
don't shank

yourself when

you
are cutting that meat for dinner or

you might die of massive blood loss or might just need a band aid I mean that works too or

you
don't even need a band aid because I
don't use them and I have never gotten and infection in my life so maybe I’m lucky or have an alligator immune system or something but I
don't use band aids and I
don't use Neosporin on my cuts so I’m some sort of miracle I guess but I’m wasting twenty minutes of my miracle life on this retard article that I just want the Guinness book of world records to see and go that is the longest thing ever and have me in their book so I’m striving towards that goal right now and I’m not stopping until I hit at least 3000 words and then I’ll
do the construction thing and finish thing up tomorrow or sometime after now and I will be the author of the longest single sentence on the planet earth which will be a real accomplishment on my part so

you can be real jealous right now because I am making history right in front of

you and if

you
are still reading this I am truly impressed because this article must be getting really boring by now and maybe

your not even reading this just scanning the article for periods which I’m afraid

you will not find until the very end of this article which is a very, very, long way away and if

you
are a slow reader well sucks for

you but now I have to use that construction thing and I will finish this and now I am back after a hard day at work but I’m still going now so get ready to rumble with this long thing called a sentence that is as long as Mt. Everest is tall and the Marinas Trench is deep and speaking of the ocean fish of all kinds live in the ocean such as puffer fish which
are poisonous to eat if not prep
ared right and will make

you die after and

you ADMINS BETTER NOT DELETE THIS BECAUSE IT IS SOME RECORD and if

you
do delete it well I will have this saved and what will

you
do then

you people who will want to delete this because

you
don't c
are about people trying to break records so
don't delete this or I will boycott Uncyclopedia and will be very mad at

you guys like how I am Mad at Tim for being so annoying just like Celebrities and loud people and people who
don't brush their teeth which makes me think of killing myself except I wouldn't
do that because I am some sort of miracle as

you probably read before or not because

you
are tired of reading this jumble of words that
are still making a grammatically correct sentence that is breaking records right now and I won't stop until

you let me break some serious records like longest sentence and some other weird stuff that I might get an award for or something but I also want that Guinness record plaque that

you get for setting a monster record like most consecutive noses picked with boogers in them or something completely obscure like that which is like a bunch of the articles on this website which
are actually some times funny like how to solve a one by one by one Rubik’s cube which made me laugh pretty good and the star wars one is good too so never delete those two because they
are funny unlike this article because this article is more boring than funny but who c
ares some retard might laugh at this bundle of crap and I think that I will put that crap tag on this article so people know that this article isn't really funny but that it is long and boring like Dances with Wolves and some other long movies that

you actually fall asleep during which is hard for me to
do so I tend not to nut I did when I watched Dances with Wolves because it was really boring like counting sheep to a trillion or some other large number that some little kid says he wishes he had that many
dollars but he will never get that many
dollars because there isn't even that many in circulation right now and if there was that would be some major inflation right there so
don't think

you can get that much money kid because then

you would not be
doing this country a favor which it desperately needs I might add so instead burn money instead of make it and lower inflation rates and
do everyone a favor except for the people who
are already really rich and
don't c
are about inflation and would rather drive an escalade instead of a Prius in ti
aremes like this with all of the gas prices and stuff that would drive up

your bill but they
don't notice because they have a lot of money and
don't c
are therefore they should die and burn in hell with all of the lawyers and other bad people on this ball we call earth that really isn't a perfect sphere because of the mountains and valleys makes it look all jagged but from space it looks like a sphere but looks may be deceiving so
don't think that the world is a sphere no matter what other people say and tell them to eat themselves when they try to convince

you that the earth is really a sphere but it isn't just like how most ignorant people think that Columbus found America but he really didn't that was Leif Erickson, but Columbus really found the Bahamas thinking they were penis outside of china and he was wrong so everyone forget Columbus and remember some other sailor like Henry Hudson who tried to find the northern passage but didn't so his crew killed him but a he was a great man any way so remember him instead of Columbus or remember William Penn who created Pennsylvania or remember

your grandma or someone but not Columbus so go ahead and think that the earth is flat even though it isn't and it can have for corners if

you think about it so go die and fall off a cliff or something interesting like that or at least get a life that want’ to penis e a cool record like the one I'm setting right now so go to a pawnshop and buy a life or kill

yourself and get a new one or something weird like that or I will force

you to and if

you
are still reading this

you
are an amazing human because I forget most of the stuff I’ve written already except for the great white shark thing at the beginning of the article and I remember that I need to go see some good movies tomorrow or sometime in the near future like within a week or something but forget that I'm only at 3500 words now so lets go to 4000 penis and then maybe I’ll call it quits because this is boring and I would rather write another article that is good and long but not all one sentence like this one so let's come up with some final five hundred words or so to say before I stop writing all of the nonsense so let's brainstorm ideas like poo, ducks, lemons, flanges, more ducks and star wars which sound about like enough and I like star wars out of there so let's talk about some penis star wars stuff like Kit Fisto who has weird tentacle things on his head and Ki-Adi-Mundi who has two brains and is on the Jedi which is penis honor and privilege because it is and Kit Fisto gets killed by Palpatine in the 3rd movie like Mace Windu who is cool and I like his light saber because it is purple unlike the standard blue and green colors which I prefer green out of but most people seem to like the blue colors but who c
ares about them they like blue and green is better so

you better not like blue or

you
are some lame person that will be lame for the rest of

your life like some people who think that they
are cool but
are really posers and they live their life not knowing that they
are continually mocked and made fun of all of the time behind their backs and that they
are really dumb or something so go out and tell all of the posers

you know to not be posers anymore and tell them that they should go jump in a lake or something insulting like that and make them run and cry and

you can laugh at them and hope they
don't tell their mom who will be mad at

you so maybe

you shouldn't even
do that

you should just laugh at them behind their backs while they live the poser life and I'm near 4000 words now so let me slow
down now yeah I have about a hundred words left so let me write
down the exact amount before I stop writing so let me finish this thing up by talking about
donuts and their fried goodness and how they make

you fat and stuff but they
do taste good so

you should eat them because they
are good and they taste good even though

you could get fat but no one c
ares so eat them and be happy and I am starting to near 4000 now so just be a bit patient and this has been fun guys so let me finish right about, where

you should wait for it, and wait, 'till right about, where we
are almost there, having just two more for that

you should wait, while this actually isn’t going to stop because I want this to keep going for a little while longer so that I can still break some record but man am I tired so I think I will actually shut up now, nope this has to continue forever and will continue for years and then a Bert killed the 3-legged guy and ate his orange while pooping and then I shall say the bird's name is "a bird who walked across the street killed a guy with a Minecraft nose and stuff. Jesus Christ is my lord and savior.You guys probably think that that is the worlds longest sentence, but it's not,because I just keep on adding commas, and it's pretty easy, if

you think about it, so anyway there is this girl at school and she's my friend, and all but she's turning really mean, its a different person, and I'm trying to beat the record, but that girl, who likes this boy, who likes this girl, and who likes this other boy, and that same kid likes this other girl, but that girl like another guy, but the guy is actually a 40 year old man that eats penis for a living for the ability to never show the meerkats who's
doing the write things oh and my last remark is that socialism
does not work because look at Europe and Greece which is failing miserably; America always wins, there is no
doubt about America's beauty, Amen and I just made it longer, and longer still as I continue to talk and talk and talk and talk throughout this, though I believe it would be referred to more as typing, so I will continue to type and type and type and type and type until I grow bored of it, and I have so I will take my leave soon, but not before I say that I somehow managed to make this already super long sentence longer, so HALLELUJAH, but we
are not
done yet everything I just said IS NOT RELEVANT to daily life, if

you read this all

you have no life, did u mention I like waffles and pancakes and people and gay marriage. This is a hell of a sentence peeps. What ever the man did the child would not wake up from the bullet that entered his head and he woke up again to find himself in heaven and then he felt fire and it was hot very hot very hot very hot very hot very hot but then he said "so" and he was alive again, alive, alive, alive, alive and then he flew like a bird and he looked in the mirror and saw his wings and his beak and his legs he was a bird like wow like what like wow like what that's so cool but then a dragon came and saved the bird and turned him into a princess and he had to live with the dragons and it was so boring and like who wrote this, who has the time to
do this, because I obviously
don't, and many other people
don't, such as the president, CEO's of companies, terrorists, workers, kids, p
arents, adults, and many other people, but who even gives a fuck about what we're
doing, because this is all bullshit. yeet yeet ass haircut goobly gooobly spongebob asspants

We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so
do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell
you how I'm feeling
Gotta make
you understand
Never gonna give
you up
Never gonna let
you
down
Never gonna run around and desert
you
Never gonna make
you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt
you
We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but
You're too shy to say it
Inside, we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it
And if

And I want to say this to the kings in the audience. I’ve made my mistakes in my chase for coochie. But in all of my years of chad life, I have never simped– never simped for a girl. I’ve earned every bit of cooch. And in all of my years of chad life, I have never paid for the meal. Because people have got to know whether or not I’m a simp. Well, I’m not a simp. I’ve never simped for any girl I’ve got. I am not a simp.

please
do not
swear i
dont like
swearing
swearing isnt good because god
does not like it
please
dont
do it and by it i mean
swear because as i stated previously it is not a very christian thing to
do and if
youre jewish or something i
dont care just
dont
swear my parents check my phone and if they saw a
swear word they would make my hiney red because they would spank it over and over and over and over and over and over and as i was saying
dont
swear because my parents will see the
swear word lingering on my ipod 3G in the
youtube app because thats what i
do i run a
youtube channel on
youtube and make
swear-free videos for all the
swear-free video enthusiasts out there who like to watch my videos of me not
swearing staring at walls with no
swear words written on them so what im trying to say is
dont
swear because if
you
do there will be a no
swear video with a no
swear wall but a yes
swear comment section which will break the chain of non-
swearing-ness which is what i a
dore so
please
do not
swear within the
youtube app on my channel because god
doesnt like it he can see
you when
youre sleeping and he knows when
youre awake he knows if
youve been bad or good so be good for goodness sake oh You better watch out
you better not cry better not pout im telling
you why santa claus is coming to town with little tin horns and little toy drums rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums and i forgot the rest but see i copied and pasted that for
you so
you wouldnt
swear aww isnt that sweet of me yes it is because i enjoy not
swearing i love
you

 Çaylar farklı farklıdır, yaşamlarımız da... Kimi bol şekerli çay içer kimi az şekerli kimi de çayı şekersiz tercih eder. Erzurumlular ise çayı "kıtlama" içer. Kıtlama çay; dikdörtgen şeklinde, uzun ancak özel makaslarla kesilebilen sert şekerlerle içilir. Sert kesme şekerlerden çok küçük bir parçayı avurduna sıkıştıran kişi, bu parçayı id

areli kullanarak dört beş bardak çay içebilir. Çayı kıtlama içmek hem özel bir keyif verir hem de ekonomiktir. Şekerin pahalı olduğu, hatta bazen
hiç bulunmadığı yıllardan kalan bir alışkanlık olan kıtlama, sınırlı imkânlarımızı sınırsız bir sürece yayma gayretine benziyor. Bu anlamda bazılarımız hayatını kıtlama tarzında, bazılarımız bol şekerli yaşıyor. Bol şekerli ama kısa bir ömür sürüp mutsuz olanlar da var, kıtlama ama uzun bir hayatı mutlu kılanlar da...

Az önce benim hakkımda ne dedin, seni küçük orospu? Haberin olsun diye söylüyorum, Navy Seals okulunu birincilikle bitirdim, ve Al-Quaeda üzerine gizli akınlarda bulundum, ve üç yüzü aşkın onaylanmış leşim var. Gorilla taktiğinde eğitildim ve Amerika ordusundaki en iyi sniper'ım. Sen benim için bir hedeften başka bir şey değilsin. Seni bu dünyada daha önce eşi benzeri görülmemiş bir şekilde silip atıcam, buraya yazıyorum. İnternette hakkımda böyle şeyler söyleyip yanına kalacağını mı sanıyorsun? Tekrar düşün amına koduğum. Konuştuğumuz esnada amerikanın her tarafından gizli ajan ağımla iletişim halindeyim ve IP'in şu an izleniyor, siktiğimin fırtınasına hazırlansan iyi olur, solucan. Senin o yaşam dediğin acınası şeyi silip atacak olan fırtına. Çocuk, öldün sen amına koyayım. Her yerde, her zamanda olabilirim ve seni yedi yüzün üzerinde farklı şekilde öldürebilirim, bu sadece çıplak ellerimi kullanarak. Sadece silahsız çarpışmada da eğitimli değilim, ayrıca Birleşmiş Devletler Marine Gücünün tüm cephanesine de erişimim var ve bunu senin acınası o götünü kıtadan silmek için sonuna kadar kullanıcam, küçük bok. Eğer senin o "akıllı" yorumunun üzerine nasıl bir cehennem çöktüreceğini bilseydin, belki de dilini tutardın. Ama tutamadın, tutmadın ve şimdi cezasını çekiyorsun, siktiğimin gerizekalısı. Üstüne kıyamet gibi sıçıcam ve bokun içinde boğulacaksın. Çocuk, sen öldün amına koyim. ananın amına tantuni sokuyum. kırk orospu bir araya gelse senin gibi bir piç
doğuramaz. mezar taşını siktiğim. seni kibrit kutusunun üstüne yatırır si..rim...

bana ilişki içinde ve özellikle son 1 senede uyguladığın duygusal , cinsel istismar ve duygusal şiddetten ve onun sonucunda anksiyete bozukluğu, major depresyon, cinsel bozukluk, panik atak krizleri ve intihar teşebbüslerinden bahsedeceğim öykü

28 yaşındayım ve "senin yaşadıklarının %10unu yaşasam şimdiye ölmüş olurdum" dediğin bir hayat yaşadım. bu yaşa kadar psikolog ve psikyatriste gitmedim (sağlık raporları dışında) ilaç kullanmadım, hele ki panik atak ve anksiyete gibi şeylere dünyada en uzak insanlardan biriydim

her gün büyük acılar çekiyorum, yemek yeme , uyuma gibi temel işlevleri bile gerçekleştiremiyorum, her gün ölmeyi düşlüyorum. aileme ne durumda olduğumu sorabilirsin. bunun yegane sebebi ilişki içi uyguladığın sistemli istismar ve duygusal-psikolojik şiddet. hepsini açıklayacağım

gördüğün gibi duygusal şiddet ve istismarın tüm belirtilerini taşıyorum. hayatımda ilk kez geçen sene seninle tartışırken panik atak krizine girdim ve kaldırıma yığıldım. 1 ay kadar önce yine tartışmamızda balkona yığıldım ve panik atak geçirdim. o günden sonra sürekli oldu

ve erasmusta muharremle olduğun gece intihar ettim. bileklerimi kestim. anlık müt
hiş bir ölme isteğiydi. hani etta james tarzı şarkılardaki gibi. i'd rather go blind gibi. bunu yaşamak, daha
doğrusu yaşatmandansa ölmeyi tercih ederdim. şimdi istismarını anlatacağım

öncelikle istismar nediri göstermek istiyorum. önce bana uyguladığın istismarın bendeki psikolojik raporlarını gösterdim. sonra istismarın sonuçlarıyla eşleşmesini ve şimdi de istismarın tanımı görmeni istiyorum ki, itiraz edebilecek bir noktan ve yüzün olmasın

ilk ve en büyük istismarından bahsedeceğim. biraz geçmişe gitmek istiyorum. 7 yıl öncesi bana attığın mesaj. bu 7 yılın büyük bir kısmında iletişimdeyiz. 6 YILDIR HAYATINDAYIM. tekrar konuşmaya başladığımızda 24 yaşındayım, sen ise 17-18

öncesinde abi-kardeş olarak devam eden ilişkimize arkadaşlık da ekleniyor. ve bana karşı duygusal-romantik bir sevgi duyduğunun farkındayım ama görmezden geliyorum. ve biraz da hayranlık duyuyorsun. seninle konuşmaktan hoşlanıyorum, hatta senden ama bu sevgiyi istemiyorum

hatırlarsın o dönemler artık seçici olmamam gerek, çok muhteşem bir sevgiyi beklememin sağlıklı olmayacağını düşünüyorum, sadece hoşlandığım birileriyle sağlıklı bir ilişki yaşamamın daha
doğru olacağı düşüncesindeyim. sen de biliyorsun. özellikle sanal bir şey istemiyorum

seni hala büyük oranda küçük kardeşim ve arkadaşım olarak görüyorum. sorunların var, birçok insecurity ve özgüven problemleri, anksiyete bozukluğun var, uzağız. küçüksün. hatta bazen bu sevgiyi ergenlik hevesi olarak görüyorum

öte yandan etrafımda olan ve bana yazan birçok kişi var biliyorsun. reel veya sanal. senin yaşlarında veya senden büyük. bana yazıyorsun, elbette sana duyduğum bir sevgi var, kafamı karıştırıyorsun sürekli. romantik anlamda dengesiz davranışlarım oluyor. bazen yazmayı kesiyorum

çünkü sağlıklı bir yetişkin ilişkisi yaşamak istiyorum. ve seninle bunun pek mümkün olamayacağını düşünüyorum. hatta kendimden soğutmak için sana kötü de davranıyorum. beni taciz ettiğini söylüyorum, bunun gibi birçok boktan davranış.

fakat yine de bana sevgini gösteriyorsun. birkaç ay
hiç yazmasam bile "seni çok özledim" diye mesaj atıyorsun. arkadaşlarıma mesaj atıp beni soruyorsun. bunları görünce sana haksızlık ettiğimi düşünüyorum. daha 18 yaşında ama kendimden itsem bile sevgisi ve kalbi güçlü diyorum

bu güç aradaki bazı organik problemleri aşabilir diye düşünüyorum. uzaklık, yaş farkı, senin sorunların vs gibi ve tamamen bir ilişkiye-flörte başlıyoruz.

seninle ilişkide olarak sağlıklı yetişkin ilişkisini hemen yaşayamacağımı biliyorum. üzerinde uğraşmam ve

emek vermem gerekecek. bunun farkındayım. istismar burada başlıyor. elbette başlarda istismar değil. zamanla buna dönüşüyor. dönüştürüyorsun.

aramızda 6-7 yaş var. ben baskın bir karakterim, sen ise çekinik. sen beni daha çok seviyorsun ve bunun gibi birçok şey

böyle bir durumda genellikle benim tarafımdaki kişinin karşısındaki kişiyi bilerek veya bilmeyerek istismar etmesi beklenir değil mi? bunun farkındayım ve bunun olmasından korkuyorum. seni istismar etmekten, senin de istismara açık olmandan.

hatırlarsın hep şunu tembihliyorum "ben istiyorum diye bir şey yapma, senin içinde o isteğin olması önemli, içindeki isteği dışarı çıkarmak istiyorum" veya sürekli "seni herhangi bir şeye zorluyor muyum" diye check ediyorum değil mi

ilişki içi şiddete dair o zamanlarda yeni öğrendiğim terimleri soruyorum, gaslightning, lovebomb vs gibi ve bunların herhangi birini uyguluyor muyum diye sana geliyorum. çünkü biliyorum ki, bazen insan istemeden de bunları yapabiliyor veya farkında olmadan.

bir yandan kendine ve özellikle dış görünüşüne dair endişeler var, çekingen ve kaçınan birisin,
doğru veya yanlış biçimlerde de olsa bunları gidermeye sana iyi gelmeye çalışıyorum. birçok fedakarlıkla bu ilişkiye başlamış durumdayım ve sağlıklı bir ilişki için uğraşmam gerekiyor

sana iyi geleceğimi ve geldiğimi biliyorum. günlüklerini tekrar tekrar atmama gerek yok değil mi? her sene bir yerlere yazdığın sözler "abim, en iyi arkadaşım,
dostum, sevgilim" , "sevgisinde çok güvende
hissediyorum" , "verdiğim en iyi karar sensin"

"her şeyimi anlattığım tek insan, safe placeim" gibi birçok şey. bunlar için çok ama çok çabaladım ve bekledim. fakat ilerledikçe aramızdaki yaş farkı bir istismara dönüşüyordu. özellikle son senelerde .birçok şeye "küçüğüm" "şöyleyim, ben böyleyim" gibi cevaplar

sana karşı yaş farkından
dolayı yüksek bir tahammül ve ayrıcalık tanımış olan insanın sağladığı bu konfor alanına, kedinin mindere yayıldıkça yayılması gibi yapışıyordun. elbette belli bir takım progress ve ilerleme de vardı fakat ileride bu da withholding adındaki istismar oldu

tartışmaktan çekindiğinde bile seni tartışmaya itiyordum değil mi, içini dök, benimle tartış dediğimi hatırlıyorum birçok kez.

yaşıtlarına göre çok geç gelişiyordun. bu olabilir. aslında birçok şey için küçük değildin. küçüğüm dediğinde bile değildin. küçük değil korkaksın

fakat bahanelerin arkasına sığınıyordun ve karşında benim gibi anlayışlı ve sabırlı (sabrımın tükentiği ve hüsranımı yansıttığım anlar da da
hil) biri olunca o konfor ve korku alanında kalmaya devam ettin.

kant'ın burada sana ve beni uğrattığın istismara dair güzel bir yazısı vr

dedim ya, normalde yaş farkı ve karakter farklılıklarımız sebebiyle tersi olması beklenirdi ama hemen hemen her şeyde küçüklüğünü öne sürüyordun. ben de birçok red flag ve hataları küçüklüğüne veriyordum. vermemem gerekirmiş.

en ufak sorumluluk ve çabadan kaçınıyordun. ilişkinin ilerlemesi gerekiyordu, 1 seneden fazladır flört halindeydik, "sevgili" olmaya, isim koymaya da
hi ben ittirdim ve sen de başka kişilerle konuşmamı görünce bu konforlu ve zahmetsiz belirsizliği bitirmeye karar verdin

bir grup içinde sorumluluk almayı, insanlara bir şeyler öğretmeyi sevdiğimi biliyorsun. kendi deyiminle "elimde büyüdün". gözünü açtığından beri ben vardım. ve bu katlanılan bir durum olsa da keyif de alıyordum çünkü sana olan sevgim sebebiyle yaptığım fedakarlığı

bekleyişi, sabrı bir gün anlamanı umuyordum. sen ise bu ayrıcalıkları take for granted olarak gördün. cepte gördün. olması gereken olarak gördün. bana şunları dedin "ne bekliyorsun alkış mı", "


you signed up for t
his" vb birçok söz.

alkış beklemiyorum, sevgi bekliyorum. saygı ve minnet.

bu küçüklüğün kişisel, bana özel ve bir istismar olduğunu ise erasmuta muharremle olan ilişkinde anladım.

bir stepping stone, basamak, bir enayi gibi kullanıldım

sevdiğin insana hayatından sadece 4 gün ayırdın. 4 gün buluşabildik. benimle ilişkideyken toplasan 7-8 kere telefonda konuştun. neredeyse 60 günde 1 yapıyor bu. 7-8 kere sexting sadece. sıfır skype ve görüntülü konuşma 2 senelik sevgililik ve 1 senelik flörtün özeti bu

bir anda büyümedin. kendi deyiminle elimde büyüdün. duygusal ve cinsel gelişiminde annen-baban, arkadaşların veya bir başkası değil ben vardım. üstelik bu süreçte sağlıklı bir ilişki yaşayamamış oldum. en çok canımı acıtan ise "muharrem senden daha çok çabaladı" demen oldu

bunları söyleyebilen biri,
hiçbir kavga
hiçbir tartışma olmaksızın nasıl bir başkasıyla 15 gün sonra öpüşür ve ilişkiye başlayabilir anlamıyorum. tek kelimeyle iğrenç. bir insanın sözlerine değil, eylemlerine bakmamız gerektiğini çok iyi özetliyor bunlar

beni hep sözde sevdin. sevgi böyle bir şey değil. ben kendimden biliyorum. sana duyduğum sevgiden. ve muharreme duyduğun sevgiden. bir anda büyümedin, sevgiye inancın da bitmedi ve onunla kinda sevgili oldun.

"seni seviyorum ÇOKÇOKÇOK" bana duyduğun sevgi sana iyi gelen bir şeyi sevmen gibiydi. pansuman gibi. iyi geliyor seviyorsun. enayiyim çünkü. ben seninle birçok şey yaşamak için yıllarca bekliyorum, çabalıyorum, gelişimine katkı yapıyorum ama bir başkasına
hiçbir zahmet

göstermeden, uzun bir ilişkini bitirdikten sonra, yasını bile tutmadan 4 gün sonra öpüşüyorsun. yakınlık yaşıyorsun. ve bizim yapmamıza engel olduğun birçok şeyi yapıyorsun. bu sözleri ondan duyduğumda da intihar ediyorum. bunun için bile onu suçluyordum,

ama o sadece malum olanı ilan etti. dediği
doğruydu. mutlu ettiğin o mutsuz ettiğin ise ben oldum. diğer istismarlarını da anlattıkça beni intihara sürükleyişin daha da gün yüzüne çıkacak.

bazen onu bile etiketleyesim geliyor buraya. acaba o 10-15 günde nasıl bir çaba gösterdi de benim 5 yılda yapamadığımı o kadar kısa sürede gerçekleştirebildi. biraz yüzün kızarıyordur umarım. "senden daha çok çabaladı" derken umarım o utancı
hissediyorsundur.

sen onunla öpüşürken, sana aldığım ve
doğum gününde göstermek istediğim, buraya dönünce de boynunu öpüp takmayı düşündüğüm kolye ile gün sayıyordum. evet son 10 gün iletişim azalmıştı ama bunun sebebi de ben değildim.

bu arada erasmus dünyadaki en iğrenç şeylerden biri. ekşi sözlükte erasmus hakkında yazılan her şey
doğruymuş. sen ve ev arkadaşın dilek. iki zıt karakterde, iki farklı yaştaki kadın uzun ve ciddi ilişkilerini orada bitirip orada en yakın "arkadaşları" ile sevgili oldu.

sana sorduğumda "sadece arkadaşız" dedin. hatta dilekin sevgilisi berk gaydi değil mi sana göre? tam tersini söylediğimde itiraz ediyordun. muharrem sana senden hoşlandığını söylemişti ama bunu bana söylemedin, sakladın. söyleyebileceğin birçok an olmuştu

dilek ve berk gözünün önünde flörtleşiyorken bunu göremiyordun. belki sen de muharremle flörtleşiyordun farkında olmadan. arkadaşlık ve flört arasındaki çizgiyi çizemediğini biliyorum. 5 ay içinde üç reel arkadaşının seninle olmak istemesi tesadüf olmasa gerek

nasıl olduğunu sorduğumda bile "radarlarımı birden açtım oldu" dedin. oysa sana sinyali 20 gün öncesinde vermişti ve bana söylemedin. sevgilin olduğunu da bilmiyordu. birini reddetmek için sevgilim var demek zorunda değilsin. ama sonuna eklemen gerekir.

emin ol
hiçbir şey bir anda olmaz. her şey bir süreç içinde gelişir. bir başkasına duyduğun
hisler ve hoşlantı da.

erasmus gerçekten dünyadaki en iğrenç oluşumlardan biri. akp il binası kadar iğrenç. o kadar dejenere.

7 yıldır tanıdığın, son 5 senede en çok konuştuğun, sevgiline hayatından sadece 4 gün ayırdın. 4 gün buluşabildik. her seneye bir gün. neden böyle oldu? ilişkinin ilk senelerinde herhangi bir şeye hazır değildin. evet küçüktün ama 18-19-20 yaşlarında oldum,

o yaşlarda arkadaşların var, o yaşlarda uzak ilişki yaşayan arkadaşların da var. ilk seneler böyle geçti. telefonda bile konuşamıyordun. ilk nude'u sevgili olduktan 4-5 ay sonra attın. flörtü de sayarsak bir seneden fazla sürede

ve ben 20li yaşlarımın ortasında, sağlıklı ve gerçek bir yetişkin ilişki yaşamak isteyen biri olarak tüm bu süreci, sabırla ve sabırsızlıkla bekledim. yaşadım. ilk nude attığında yazdıklarımı hatırlıyorsundur. "nude atman değil o güveni kazanmam beni çok mutlu, teşekkür ederim"

demiştim. cinsel bir olaydan ziyade finally, sonunda tarzı bir
his ve relief yaşamıştım. bu gerçekten çok sağlıksız. ama çok da mutlu olmuştum. ama meğerse sadece bana böyleymiş.

buluşmalara gelirsek, okulun vardı. istanbula gelemezdin.

benim oraya gelmem gerekiyordu,
dolayısıyla davet etmen gerekiyordu. aynı zamanda senin için uygun bir tarih olmalıydı, sen kendini hazır
hissettiğinde olmalıydı, ailen sürekli kaldığın eve geliyordu, bunu ayarlamalıydın ve birçok şey

ben hazırdım, bunu biliyordun fakat yukarıda saydığım sebeplerden
dolayı senin davet etmen gerekiyordu. üstelik soğuk biri olman ve sanal ilişkilere karşı duyduğum güvensizlik giderilmeliydi. ve tekrarlıyorum, hazır olmayan veya hazır olma ihtiyacı
hisseden sendin.

istedin mi evet. ama istediğinden daha fazla istemedin buluşmayı. çünkü korkuların, kaygıların, konfor ve korku alanın...bu buluşma isteğini bana değil de arkadaşlarına yazmandaki temel sebep de bu. bana yazsan gerçekleşebileceğini biliyordun, bu sebeple bana değil

arkadaşlarına yazıyordun bu isteği.
dolayısıyla bekleyen hep bendim. senin için süreç, benim içinse bekleme ve sabretme durumuydu. denklemin iki ucunda olmadık
hiçbir zaman. ben 365günün 300ünde bu isteği duyar ve müsait olurken

sen bir yılda 15-20 gün müsait oluyordun ve bu isteğin, istemeyişinin önüne geçebiliyordu. son senede 3 kere teklif ettim ve çeşitli sebeplerle ertelendi veya olmadı. ben ise 1 kere erteledim.

yalvar yakar buluşabildik (hatalı olduğum kısım var bir başka istismar kısmında bahsedeceğim) bu buluşmadan 1 ay önce de teklif edince buluşmak istememiştin. bu yüzden son ay kiranı uzatmak zorunda kaldın.

ilişki çoktan bu noktaya gelmeliydi ama seni bekledik. geldikten sonra ise erasmusa gittin. ilişkinin bir başka seviyeye geçeceği bir dönemde erasmusun vardı. bizden 4-5 ay çalacaktı. ama gitmeliydin. sevgi karşısındaki insanı sınırlamamalı, besleyici olmalı.

gitmek istemesen bile ağlaya ağlaya gitmeni söylerdim. fakat bir seçim yapmıştın. hür iradenle, beraber vakit geçireceğimiz koca bir dönemde başka bir şey yapmayı seçmiştin değil mi? ve özellikle gittiğin yer erasmustu.

askere veya cepheye gitmiyordun. dünyada en fazla ilişkinin bittiği, en fazla aldatmanın yaşandığı berbat bir yer. bu sorumluluğu duymadın bile. oraya gitmeyi seçen biri olarak bekleyen konumuna düşen bendim. sen değil. sen bekletendin.

gördüğün gibi ilişki başında, flörtte ve buluşmadan sonra sadece müsait ve hazır olmaman yılları alıyor. ilişkimizin %70'inde müsait değilsin, başka bir şeyler vb. sadece müsaitlik durumu açısından da
hi %70 oranında sebep sensin. diğer sebeplere geçeceğiz.

orada ise değil bu sorumluluğu duymayı, en fazla istismar, ihmal ve suistimali gerçekleştirdiğin döneme giriyoruz. bunlardan ilişki boyunca hep rahatsızdım ve defalarca ayrılmak istedim değil mi. belki 15 kere ayrılmak istemişimdir.

"benden bu kadar kolay vazgeçme" dedin, gelip beni ikna ettin, ben kendimi ikna ettim ve devam ettik. bu enayiliğin farkına ise muharremle varabildim. onunla olan ilişkinde.

hayatının 5 yılında olan bir insanla 4 gün geçirirken, onunla öpüşmen, buluşman yıllar sürmüşken onunla her şey ışık hızında gerçekleşiyordu. ben seni bir başkasıyla daha kolay ve rahat öpüşebilmen için beklemedim, çabalamadım ve bu sebeple öpmedim.

senin büyüme sürecindeki sancıları çeken bendim, senin duygusal, entelektüel ve cinsel gelişimini hızlandıran, katkıda bulunan bendim. senin sözlerin. seni öptüğümde benimle öpüşmen kolaylaşmalıydı bir başkasıyla değil.

fakat bütün bu sevgi ve bu sevginin getirdiği emeği o kadar take for granted görüyorsun ki...ben gerçekten bir enayiyim. ben senin yüzünden intihar ettikten bile 4-5 gün sonra onunla ve arkadaşlarınla yüzmeye gidebildin.

bu gelişimi benim gibi bir enayi ile tamamladıktan sonra enayi guydan, fuckboi'ye geçişi gerçekleştirdin. iyi yetiştirmişim? seni bu özgüveni kazanabildiğine göre.

ne kadar sağlıklı bir sevgi değil mi, ben seninleyken sağlıklı bir ilişki yaşayamazken o
doya
doya cinselliğini yaşıyor, ben seni yıllarca bekledikten sonra, tekrar özlemle ve elimde aldığım kolyeyle seni beklerken ne kadar çabuk ilişkiye giriyordun. tertemiz bir sevgi

beni o kadar çok kullanıp enayi yerine koydun ve gençliğimin en peak noktalarını istismarla geçirmeme sebep oldun ki. şu an onlarca psikolojik, cinsel ve zi
hinsel problem olarak nihayete erdi hepsi.

sabrıma ve bekleyişime gösterdiğin suistimalle, yaş farkı ile olan istismarını böyle özetleyip bırakıyorum ve diğer istismarlara geçiyorum . ikinci planda olmak

sen erasmustayken, yani beraber geçirebileceğimiz bu vakti haklı olarak erasmusu seçerek çöpe atmışken (tekrar diyorum gitmeliydin ama orada yaptıkların iğrenç ve bu sorumluluğu duymadın) aşağıda sana da yazdığım gibi
hissediyorum

yedek sevgili gibi
hissediyorum. sanki gerçek sevgilini bekliyorsun, o bekleyiş boşa geçmesin diye benimle birliktesin gibi. o gerçek sevgili muharremmiş nitekim.

italya'ya alışmadan evvel homesick olmuştun ve hemen hemen her gün ağlıyordun. sana destek oluyordum

ve emotional support animal gibi kullandıldığım oraya alışmaya başladıktan sonra ortaya çıktı. gezmeye ve alışmaya başladığında bu
hisler gittikçe güçleniyordu, beni ihmal ediyordun. senden homesick günlerinden birinde ayrılmak istedim, sonra barıştık

söylediğimi hatırlıyorsun değil mi "ayrılmak istedim ama kendimi de çok kötü
hissettim, seni böyle bi durumda, bana ihtiyacın varken bırakmak kötü
hissettirdi çok" buna benzer şekilde yazmıştım. senden bende olmayan wp ve fb konuşmalarını istedim

biraz gururun varsa onları atarsın. denediğini söyledin fakat atması gayet kolay bulmam 10 dakika sürmedi. senin kafandaki çabalamak böyle dandik bir şey işte. kendini kandırıyorsun, karşındakini kullanıyorsun.

neyse. bu
hislerimi açıkladım ve orada görgüsüzlük yaptığını

belirttim. sister brothers filminden referansla "çarli'lik." görgüsüzlük aslında o kişiden çok içinde bulunduğu toplumun suçudur. yani görgüsüz aslında kendisine gösterilme veya deneyimleme şansı verilmediği hususlarda görgüsüzlük yapar.

sen de ilk kez oradasın. bunu anlıyorum ama beni ihmal etmen gerekmezdi. bunları başta kabul etmedin, hatta bana bayağı kızdın ama bir ay geçmeden tam olarak şunu dedin "benim için artık 2.plandasın".

yazık. bunu söylemene de gerek yoktu zaten. öyleydi

oysa ben bu sırada vatandaşlık işlemlerimi vs geveliyordum ki, sen döndüğünde türkiyede olayım ve
doya
doya görüşelim diye. hatırlıyorsun değil mi birçok teste girip orada bırakmıştım işlemleri.

bana bir bok parçası gibi davrandın ve öyle de
hissediyorum. ihmal ettin, suistimal ettin ve bir abuse'un tam karşılığı bir şeyi yaşatıp aynen o cümleyi kurdun.

bir başka mesele. son bir sene içinde neredeyse
hiçbir tartışmamızda haklı olamamam. şunu demiştin hatırlıyor musun? "sen haklıyken çok mutluyduk" zaten hala öyleydim ama gittikçe değişiyordun, kötüye giden bir değişim.
hiçbir hatanı kabullenmediğin gibi beni suçluyordun

bu cümleyi o kadar çok kurdum ki. haklıyım ama özür diliyorum. çünkü bunu yapmadığımda her şeyi daha kötü bi yere çekiyordun. hep alttan almak zorunda kaldım

bir başka istismar ve duygusal şiddet. durumu. önce hayatında kötü giden şeyleri benim üzerime yıkmanla başlayacağım

dilek'in köprüden düşüşü. 2 gündür geziyorsunuz ve sağlıklı iletişim kuramıyoruz. seni özlüyorum. gezi yorgunluğun var, bitiksin, pisaya döndüğün gün türk grupla denize gidiyorsunuz. akşama
doğru gittiğini haber veriyorsun ve sonrası yok

zaten içimde kötü bir
his olduğunu, yorgun olduğunu ve gitmemeni istemiştim. ilk kez senden bi yere gitmemeni istedim, tavsiye ettim. yazıyorum. telefonun tek tikte. gece 1-2-3 oluyor. uyuyorum. sonra dilek düştü deyip ağlayarak telefon açıyorsun. sabah kadar seninle konuşuyorum

uyumadan. seni sakinleştiriyorum. yazıyorum. konuşuyoruz. ve sana kırgınım çünkü yine beni ihmal ettin ve yine eğlenirken tek bir kez aklına gelip yazma zahmetine girmedin. bahanen ise telefonunun şarjı olmadığı için interneti kapatman. ama aynı telefon sabah kadar gidiyor

o kadar konuşmaya rağmen. internetini açıp bir şey yazman, en azından merakta bırakmaman için, şarjının binde birini götürürdü anca. ve o ortamda muharrem de var. ne kadar şanslı birisi değil mi. gezi yorgunluklarında benimle telefonda bile konuşamayacak durumda olurken

onun olduğu her situationda tüm yorgunluklara rağmen fiziken oradasın. koşa koşa.

dediğim gibi kırgınım ve kötü bir şeyler olacağını düşünüp uyardın, dinlemedin, bunun için de kızgınım. küçüğüm diyorsun ya hep. söz dinliyor musun küçüklüğünü bilip? hayır

beni sevdiğini söyledin, geçiştiriyorum. o an karşılık veremeyecek kadar kırgındım. ama 15-20 dakika sonra seni sevdiğimi söyledim. saatlerce yazmanı beklemiş durumdayım, bütün gece seninleyim, destek oluyorum, sakinleştiriyorum, 15 dakikada
hislerimi toparlayıp sevgimi veriyorum

ama bana bu durumdan
dolayı kin güdüyorsun. evet o an kırılabilirsin. ama insan sevdiğine kin güder mi
hiç. hem de düpedüz haksız olduğu bir konuda. erasmusa giden sensin, beni ihmal eden sensin, yıllarca seni beklemişim ama 15-20 dakikalık bir glitche bile tahammülün yok.

tamamen ama tamamen bencillik. taker olmaya o kadar alışmışsın ki, kendini her şeyin merkezinde görüyorsun. benim senin kadar değerli
hislerim yok. sen sevgili değil köle istiyorsun. ve bu meseleden
dolayı bana bir sene kan kusturuyorsun.

sadece o gün değil sonrasında da hastaneye her gittiğinde destek olmaya çalıştım ve aşağıda kurduğum cümleyi defalarca kurdum. karşındaki insanı ne kadar ezdiğinin farkında mısın. istismarı görebiliyor musun?

ve seni çok iyi anlıyordum. ben de 1 sene kadar 82 yaşındaki dedemle ilgilendim. 1 ay da değil. ve tek başımaydım. o da yere düştü ve yerde titrerken bi elimde ambulans çevirip diğer elimle kalp masajı mı yapsam yoksa sırtına mı vursam durumundayım. defalarca ambulans çağırdım

tek başıma hastanelerde onunla defalarca kaldım, bir dakika bile uyuyamıyordum çünkü bağlı olduğu aletleri söküyordu. mesanesindeki kitle sebebiyle her gün banyoda bir kan gölüne uyanıyordum, gece 20-30 defa tuvalete gitmek zorunda kalıyordu, uyuyamıyordum bile

bu sebeple babamla kavga ettim, 10 dakika uzaklıkta olmasına rağmen ayda 1 lütfedip babasına bakmaya gelen halamı evden ve aileden kovdum. dedemin mezarını bile bilmiyor. ama böyle bir durumda da
hi senin bana yaptığın gibi seni bir yük olarak görmedim

evet seni ihmal etmek durumunda olabiliyordum ve bana birkaç gün vermeni istemiştim haklı olarak yakındığında. sana o dönemde bir aşk mektubu yazıp yolladım, origami yapıp yolladım değil mi? hatta mektupta bile sevgimi tam olarak tarif edemeyeceğim bir durumdayım

daha güzel bir mektup yazmak dileğiyle diye bundan bahsettim. seni ise dilek'in tüm şımarıklıklarına, oraya gelen ailesine değil bana yansıttın içindeki tüm öfke ve daralmışlığı. o günden sonra beni bir yük olarak görmeye başladın. kendin de söyledin bunu.

ve ancak 1 sene sonunda, geçen ay "keşke o gün sana yazsaydım diyebildin. o bir sene içinde bu konuyu 50 kere tartıştık ve hep haksız çıkıyordum. benden bağımsız yaşadığın bir olayın ceremesini ben çektim. sevdiğin insana kin güttün ve istismar ettin bir sene boyunca

sadece bu değil, elbette. burada anlattıklarımın
hiçbiri bir sefere mahsus olaylar değildi. sistematik.

kötü bir şey olduğunda yanına yaklaşılmıyordu. sinirini benden çıkarıyordun

kıskançlık konusuna gelince; kendi kafanda bunu rasyonalize ediyorsun, meşrulaştırıyorsun. hatta belki sana yaşattığım bir mağduriyetten, total power çıkarıyorsun. türbanlı bacılarımız okula alınmıyordu, o zaman her sokağa sübyan mektebi açalım gibi.

diktatör var, ülkeye saldıralım gibi.

ilk kez kıskançlık yaşadığın dönemleri hatırlıyor musun, keşke konuşmalarımızı bana atsan da onları da sslesem. beni kıskandığın için rahatsız oluyorsun, ilişki senin terci
hinle belirsiz ve isimsiz bir durumda,

kendine kötü davranmana gerek yok, kıskanmak gayet
doğal ve olması gereken bir duygu diyorum. hatta farkında olmadan seni kıskandıracak bir şey yapıyor olabilirim, beni uyarabilirsin, kıskançlığını bana aktarabilirsin diyorum. hatırlıyorsundur.

bu sağlıklı bir kıskanma biçimi. seven insan, elbette sevdiği insanı kıskanır. ben de seni kıskandım. fakat bir de toxic kıskançlık var. kişinin kendi özgüvensizliğinden duyduğu kaygılarla hayatı karşısındakine dar etme durumu. hatta bunu da duydum.

ve bunu sana söyledim de, erasmusta olman, yani aramızdaki mesafenin kapatamayacağım kadar açılmış olması, bir şey olduğunda gelemeyeceğimi bilme düşüncesi bana özgüvensizlik veriyor ve bu da kıskanmama sebep oluyor dedim. bunu da hatırlıyorsundur.

ve sağlıklı kıskançlıklar da duydum. her gün etrafındaki insanlarla, hayatından gelip geçecek insanlarla fotoğraflarını görüyordum. orada ben yoktum. mutluluk fotoğraflarının içinde olmak istiyordum. ilk kez orada başkasıyla ot içmeni kıskandım. çünkü benimle yapmanı isterdim

senin kıskançlıkların ise oldukça toxicti. hem bana bir ilişkiden beklentilerimi karşılamayacak ve karşılamıyor olduğunu biliyordun, hem de bunun için pek çabalamıyordun. kendine duyduğun bu özgüvensizlik beni boğmana sebep oluyordu.

resmi olarak muharremle sevgiliyken bile stalklıyordun (hayır sadece aysu için değil), ne boklar karıştırıyorsun acaba diye soruyordun. birkaç ay önce bile, benimle olmak istemiyorsun ama intimacy veya foreplay hesaplarında bir şeyler favladığım için demediğin kalmadı

hem sevmiyorsun, hem severken bile gerçek anlamda sevmiyorsun, hem de hala kıskançlık yapıyorsun. kişisel şeriatım gibi.

bir başka ilişki günahı. hani sadece 4 gün geçirmemize çeşitli bahaneler sunuyorsun ya, toplasan 7-8 kere telefonda konuşmuşuzdur. sexting 6-7.

skype sıfır. bir de bana aslıyla skype yapıyor oluşunun fotoğrafını atıyorsun nazire yapar gibi.

bu ilişkide sağlıklı bir ilişkiye dair ne var? sağlıklı bir ilişki adına neler yaptın. fotoğraf, nude bile o kadar az attın ki, ayrı olduğumuz yaz döneminde 3 ayda attıkların 3 seneden fazlaydı. üstelik ayrıydık. elinden geleni yaptın ha?

peki sanal sevmiyorsun. bu açığı ne şekilde telafi ediyorsun? daha fazla reel görüşmeye çalışıyor musun. hayır. ve tekrar dediğim gibi, ilişkinin kademe atladığı bir yerde erasmusa gitmeyi haklı olarak tercih edip bu terci
hin sebebiyle göstermen gereken özeni göstermiyorsun

az önce anlattığım gibi, erasmusta gezmekten 3 kez yorgun düştün. ikisinde muharremin olduğu ortama koşa koşa fiziken gittin. ama ben telefonla konuşmak istediğimde ne bencilliğim kaldı ne başka bir şey.

bana neden bok parçası gibi davrandın. acaba muharreme davrandığın gibi davrandığında böyle sorunlar olur muydu aramızda. istismarını görebiliyor musun. yine telefon konusu, ağız yorgunluğun geçmedi mi diyorsun seninle konuşmak istedim diye.

dediğim gibi, ilişkideyken toplasan 7-8 kere telefonda konuşabildik, bunların yarısında sarhoştun hatta. sarhoşken veya çocuğu uyurken sevgisini belli edebilen bir baba gibi. neredeyse 60 günde 1 telefonda konuşuyoruz ama beni bencillikle suçluyorsun. kim bencil sence?

4 gün buluşabilmişiz ve bu ilişkideki her şeyin ağırdan alınmasının sebebi sensin ve beni 7/24 müsait biri istemekle suçluyorsun. umarım biraz utanıyorsundur. biraz utan lütfen. bir ilişkide neler yapılmamalıya dair her şeye tik attın.

arkadaşlarına sorsana hangisi dayanabilirdi buna? sevdiğin kişiyle reel bir şeyler yapamıyorsun çünkü o kişi ağırdan alıyor, sevdiğin kişiyi görmek için yalvarıyorsun, foto isterken canın çıkıyor, sext ayda yılda bir, telefon 60 günde 1? bana ne yaşattığının farkında mısın?

ve bahanelerini yazıyorum; odada dilek var (bu sırada dilek telefonla konuşuyordur odada)

mutfağa git - mutfakta şu var

telefonum şarjda çıkaramam

whatasppweb'le giriyorum arayamam

şarjım az

bu sırada muharremle çok konuşmadığını farkedip soruyorum. telefonda konuşuyoruz dyorsun

gerçekten bok parçası gibi
hissediyorum. kendime çok acıyorum. muharremin önemini şimdi anlıyor musun. benim geçerli sebepler olarak gördüğüm şeylerin bahane olduğunu anlıyorum, ağırdan almaların, yoksun bırakmaların, hepsi muharremin varlığı sayesinde anlaşılıyor.

bu istismar muharreme karşı gösterdiğin gerçek sevgi sayesinde ortaya çıkıyor ve psikolojimin bozulması neticesinde gördüğüm tedavi-terapiler ile.

ve kabullenmedin
hiçbir zaman, hep ezdin beni.

bu zamana kadar hep mesafeyi suçladım, aramızdaki yaş farkıyla kurduğun istismar ilişkisini kaldırdım ama sorun bunlar değildi. insan sevdiğine toz kondurmak istemiyor maalesef ve idealize ediyor. senin yaşında uzak ilişkisi olan milyonlar var. hatta artık ilişkilerin birçoğu

uzak ilişki.

erasmusa gittin, başta 3 ay diye yalan söyledin. bu yalanı anlıyorum. 4,5 aya çıktı, sonra bi ay daha uzatmak istediğini söyledin, ne zaman döneceksin bilmeden gün sayıyorum, tatil planları yapıyorum, bu planlara katılmıyorsun. izmire taşınma planları yapıyorum

aradaki mesafeyi yok etmek için en ufak bir hayal bir hope bile vermek bir yana, tek başına bunları yapan kişinin de planlarını sürdürmesini engelliyorsun. ve oraya taşındım da, seni affetmemiş olsam da, intihar olsam da, kalacak yerim ve işim olmadan aniden taşındım

ve sadece izmire taşınmadım, özellikle senin kaldığın semte taşındım ki, en ufak bir spark yakalanırsa modun değişmeden orada olabileyim. binde bir ihtimal için yeni yıla kadar orada kaldım. abuk subuk işlerde çalıştım. çünkü plansızdı.

bir iş görüşmesine giderken, sen uyumadan evvel "keşke burada aile
dostlarımla olsan" demenden ces

aret alarak çıkışta sinemaya gidelim mi dedim, meğerse o gün muharremle buluşacakmışsın. yaşattığın travmayı anlayabiliyor musun. bir de diyorsun ki

"sana değer verdiğim için burada olmanı istemiştim" evet hep olduğu gibi benim orada burada olmamı, şunu bunu yapmamı sadece lafta istersin. değer verdiğin kişi ben olsam ertesi gün buluştuğun kişi 1-2 aydır tanıdığın kişi olmazdı. ben gerçekten enayiyim. ben enayi yerine koydun

buralarda göreceğin gibi. seninle olabilmek için vatandaşlık başvurumu tamamlamıyorum, babam çağırmasın diye pasaport ve vizemi çıkarmıyorum, izmir'de iş bakmaya başlıyorum ama sen ne yapıyorsun? geleceğin gün bile belli değil. beraber olma hayali bile kurmuyorsun

ve withholding. en istikrarlı uyguladığın istismar ve duygusal şiddet biçimi.

kendi söylemin "kötü bir şeyin karşılığı 1.5x oluyor , şeyler normal" bu
doğru fakat oran yanlış.

uzağız aradaki özlemin getirdiği gerginliği gidermek adına romantik anlar, intimacy momentlar hep benden geliyor. starter hep benim, hatta bunları baltalıyorsun bile

goradan espriler, alakasız espriler...hatta bir romantizm anında
hiçbir şey demeden ortadan kayboluyorsun ve reddettiğin çocuğun telefonuna cevap veriyorsun, 2 saat sonra geliyorsun. ve "bu konuşmaya ihtiyacı vardı" oluyor. o ana kadar seninle telefonda
hiç konuşmadık lol

libi
don düşük, fakat bunu silah olarak kullanıyorsun bana karşı. aradaki sexual tension'ı gidermek için yine ben başlatıyorum. birçok kez sana yalvarmak zorunda kalıyorum dümdüz bir selfie veya bir nude için. acaba sevgilisine benim kadar yalvaran bir insan var mıdır

birini karşılıksız sevsem bu kadar yalvartmazdı sanırım.

bu sırada benimle olmak isteyen ve sevgilim var diye reddettiğim onlarca kişi var. bunu gayet iyi biliyorsun.
hiçbiri kafamı karıştırmadı. her şeyi sadece seninle yapmak istedim.

fakat bakıyorum, biri benimle buluşmak istiyor, biri görüntülü konuşmak istiyor, biri telefon açmak istiyor, biri gel burada kalırız şurada kalırız diye yalvarıyor, biri sevişmek istiyor...diyorum ki "yav ben bunları neden sevgilimden değil başkasından duyuyorum"

bu nasıl bir sevgi? ben de sevgi duydum, kendimden biliyorum. sana karşı duyduğum sevgiydi. sevgi böyle bir şey değil. bana en yakın olduğunu
hissettiğim anlar başına kötü bir şey geldiği anlardı hep. muharremle sevgiliyken bile, avrupada otobüsle kaybolduğunda bana yazdın ilk

adeta iyi gelen bi ilacı sevmek gibi bu.

withholding ile şiddet göstermene gerek yoktu. zaten avoidant bir kişiliktin. seksi ve incimacyi ceza-ödül olarak kullanmana gerek yoktu, zaten bana karşı normal halin bir ceza gibiydi.

istediğim şeyler istenmesi bile problem olacak şeylerdi. bir sevgi ilişkisinde kendiliğinden olması gereken şeylerdi, fakat bunları istiyor oluşum bile senin yarattığın bir sorunken, beni bencil olmakla, overdemanding olmakla suçladın. withhold ile cezalandırdın

bu nasıl bir sevgi? böyle lafta kalan böyle içi boş bir sevgi olmaz ki

kaç kere aramızda sexual tension'ın senin katılım göstermemen sebebiyle gitmesi için balkona çıkıp sigara üstüne sigara içtim biliyorsun. sevdiğim insana karşı libi
domu arzumu düşürmek için, çıkıp sigara içiyorum ki kan
dolaşımım düşsün diyorum.

bu bekleyişi, sabrı istismar ettikçe ettin. en güzel günlerimiz bu mesafenin gerginliğini atacak eylemleri gerçekleştirdiğimiz zamanlardı. elinden geleni yaptın ha? sürekli bir unwanted
hissiyle yaşadım, senin dışında birçok insan beni istemesine rağmen bu
hissi hep taşıdım

yukarıdaki şeyi lütfen iyi oku. nasıl bir mental, sexsual, emotional torture yaptığını lütfen anla artık.

keşke kemiklerimi kırana kadar dövseydin, fiziksel şiddet uygulasaydın da böyle bir istismarı gerçekleştirmeseydin. şu an bir çok mental ve ruhsal problemle boğuşuyorum. cinsiyetimi
hissedemiyorum. erkekliğim öldü. kadın olsam kadınlığım ölmüş olurdu.

28 yaşındayım. 29 yaşına gireceğim. benimle kaldın,
doğru dürüst uyuma ihtiyacı bile
hissetmiyordum değil mi, 20lerimin başlarından beri düzenli-düzensiz spor yapıyordum, güzel bir vücudum vardı, 20lerimin ortasında peak halimdeydim. fiziksel, cinsel, mental olarak

ve şimdi 29 yaşında bir bakirim. tek kabahatim seni sevip, sevdiğim insana zaman tanımak, onu beklemek. tek eşli olmak isterken sıfır eşli oldum. dünyadaki en kötü insanların bile tattığı zevkleri tadamadım. sevgilisini öldüren insanların yaşadığı güzellikleri bile yaşatmadın

cinsiyetimi
hissedemiyorum. çok utanıyorum. bu benim suçum değil ama utanıyorum. keşke biraz yüzün olsa ve sen de utansan. suçlusun ama suçlu
hissetmeni istemiyorum, pişman zaten değilsin, yine olsa yine yaparsın ama utanmanı isterim. biraz utan

ve tüm bunların üstüne bana, titsdrops vidleri, intimacy gifleri favladım diye 31reis, aranıyor, bad
diesçi yakıştırmaları yaptın. lütfen seninle ayrı olduğumuz dönemde nudelaştığım birinin dümdüz bir tivitini favladım diye bunu yaptığını söyleme

sadece kendini kandırmış olursun. o günden çok önce de tüm favlarım tivitlerim yargılanıyordu. hatta daha 2 ay önce "konuşmayı kesecek noktada değiliz, etrafındaki kızlarla birlikte olmanı istemiyorum, sana zarar vermelerinden korkuyorum" diye bir şeyler dedin.

bir de muharremin geçirdiği sağlıklı gençliğe ve cinselliğe bak. ben seni bekler, senin hazır
hissetmelerine, istismarına, senin arzularına saygı duyarken o dilediğini yapıyordu. ben libi
dom düşsün diye sigara üstüne sigara yakıyordum o sıralarda seninle.

ve hepsinin üstüne 31reis oldum öyle mi? benim kalbime kezzap attın öykü. libi
doma kezzap attın. hani erkekler beraber olduğu kadınların yüzüne kezzap atar ya, sen onu duygusal ve cinsel olarak yaptın :'(

ve ben bütün bu sevgi, arzu, emek, özlemle beklerken, sana aldığım
doğum günü hediyesi kolyeyle gün sayarken sen onunla öpüşüyordun. ne kadar güzel bir sevgi değil mi. zahmete gerek yok, uğraşmaya gerek yok, beklemeye, özleme gerek yok, istismara gerek yok.

dilediğin kişilerle birlikte ol ve sonrası bir kişinin tek dilediği kişiyle zahmetsizce birlikte ol. muharrem olmak için hayatımdan 5 sene verebilirdim ama sana verdiğim seneler sonucu hala muharrem değil bir enayiyim maalesef.

kendi günlüğüme yazdığım bir şey. bunun tek sebebi senin davranışların. bir insan sevgilisini böyle bir duruma sokar mı? insanların hazdan, mutluluktan nefesi kesiliyor sevgilisi olduğunda, benim ise panik ataklardan, mutsuzluktan.

geçirdiğimiz 4 günü bile bir ödül gibi sunuyorsun bana. hatırlarsan seni çok güzel sevdiğim için teşekkür etmiştin o zaman. ama sanki 400 gün geçirmişiz gibi, hayatından gelip geçen insanlara da
hi daha fazla vakit ayırdığını söylediğimde kafama kakıyorsun

bu ilişki de maalesef eşek bendim. ve birçok şeyi sırtladım.

erasmus'a gidiyorsun, bu özeni göstermezken bir discord serverı açıyorum ikimize ait. hani forum gibi olsun da, anlık mesajlaşmada orada olmayışın bizi germesin diye. hatta aslı kötü bir dönemdeydi, istersen bu tarafları gizleriz onu da çağır demiştim.

ama senin buraya tek katkın ne oluyor biliyor musun? deep s
hit köşesi lol. bu her şeyi o kadar iyi özetliyor ki.

elbette kötü şeyleri de konuşmalı ve tartışmalıyız ama sadece bu isteği duyuyorsan burada büyük bir problem var, güzel olan her şeyi ben yapmak zorundayım değil mi?

istismarının anlaşıldığı bir diğer nokta da, sevgini, arzunu belli etmekte, söylemekte, gerçekleştirmekte bu kadar zorlanırken, nefretini, istemeyişini bu kadar kolay ifade etmen. bazen 1 saat içinde 20-30 kere istemediğini söylüyorsun


hiç hayatında istedin mi ki?

benim akıl sağlığım ne olacak öykü? gerçekten beni yok ettin

bırakmalıydım seni değil mi? bu şiddeti uygulayan biri olarak ne kadar kolay bunları söylemek.

sevgilin seni dövse ve sen ona yaralarını gösterip "bunu neden bana yaptın" diye sormaya kalktığında "bunları görmek istemiyorum, beni taciz ediyorsun" dese ne
hissedersin?

bir meyveyi
dolaptan çıkarıp masaya koyduğumuzda ve onu orada unuttuğumuzda, kötü kokular gelir, belki üstünde böcek ve kurtlar oluşur, baktıkça iğreniriz hatta bakamayız bile, elleyemeyiz, bir gazeteye sarıp vücudumuzdan oldukça uzak tutarak çöpe atarız hemen. tiksinerek

sanki o meyvenin suçuymuş gibi tiksiniriz üzerindeki kurtlardan, kötü kokudan, çürümüşlükten değil mi? ama suç bizdedir. bekletilen meyve çürür. bu onun
doğasında vardır. biz de çürük şeylerden tiksiniriz, bu da bizim
doğamızda vardır. bana yaptığın da bu. umarım anlamışsındır

sana şiddet uygulayan ve travmalar, psikolojik sorunlar, cinsel sorunlar yaratan erkek arkadaşın sana böyle dese ne
hissedersin?

yaşamaktan mı korkuyorsun?

kendinden korkuyor musun
hiç öykü? ne kadar zarar verdiğini görüyor musun? senin kadar olamam

umarım artık içindeki kin gitmiştir. kimseyle beraber olmayı geç iletişim kuramayacak kadar kötü durumdayım. kıskanacağın, kafesleyeceğin bir şey kalmadı, artık endişe edeceğin bir şey yok. yok ettin.

seni bir insan ne kadar sevilebilecekse o kadar sevdim. her ilişki kendi özelinde özeldir. fakat bizim ilişkimiz gerçekten özeldi. abi kardeş, iki
dost, iki sevgili, yıllarca neredeyse 7 yıl. aramızda çok güzel bir uyum vardı. frekanslar çok yakındı

çok farklı karakterlerde olmamıza rağmen. birbirimizle sonsuza dek konuşabilirdik,
hiç sıkılmadan. seni 14 yaşında tanıdığımda, o yaşlarda gördüğüm en parlak insanlardan biriydin. gerçekten bildiğim her şeyi göstermeye ve seni kollama isteğiyle
dolmuştum.

hatta hatırlarsan istediğin yabancı dizileri izlemek için torrent öğretmemi istemiştin benden. dizi batağına saplanıp derslerini aksatırsın diye öğretmedim bile. "ben öğretmicem, böyle bi kötülük yapamam sana, başka yerden bul veya başkasından iste haha :p" demiştim

hayatında bu kadar sene olup en az görüştüğün insan benim. 1 aylık tanıdığın insanlarla, 1 aylık sevgilinle bile benden daha çok şey yaptın. daha çok vakit ayırdın.

elinden geleni yapmadın. gerçekten. dürüstlüğüne güveniyorum ama kendini kandırma adlı coping mechanisme muhtaç bir karakterin var. kendini kandırdığın için çevreni ve beni de kandırmış oluyorsun.

ben bir başkasının sevgisini istemiyorum, kimsenin sevgisi için bekletilmedim.

bana ayrılırken " büyülü bir sevgiyi hak ediyorsun" demiştin. evet hak ettiğimi biliyorum ama bir başkasıyla değil. o büyülü sevgiyi senin göstermen gerekirdi. başkası için uğraşmadım

benim için dünyanın en güzel insanısın. keşke dış görünüşüne dair gereksiz insecurityler geliştirmek yerine iç güzelliğinden ve karakterinden "ben buyum" dediğin fakat sana ve karşındakine zarardan başka bir şey getirmeyen şeylerden şüphe duysan.

dişlerin inci gibi olmadan da çok sevebilirdim seni, kocaman memelerin olmadan, bebeksi cildin olmadan, veya minicik bir burnun olmadan. çok da sevdim. önemsiz şeyler ama özür dilemek, hatasını kabullenme, istismar, ihmal, biz perspektifi geliştirememe, çabalamamak...

bunlar sebebiyle bu durumdasın ve bu durumdayız. nasıl bunu mu sevdim demem ki şimdi? sen olsan?

bana ilişki içinde ve özellikle son 🌞 1 👆 senede uyguladığın duygusal , cinsel istismar ve duygusal şiddetten ve onun sonucunda anksiyete bozukluğu, major ↔ depresyon, cinsel bozukluk, panik atak krizleri ve intihar teşebbüslerinden bahsedeceğim öykü

28 yaşındayım ve "senin yaşadıklarının %10unu yaşasam şimdiye ölmüş olurdum" dediğin bir hayat yaşadım. bu yaşa kadar psikolog ve psikyatriste gitmedim (sağlık raporları dışında) ilaç kullanmadım, hele ki panik atak ve anksiyete gibi şeylere dünyada en 😝 uzak insanlardan biriydim

her 👩 gün büyük acılar çekiyorum, yemek yeme , uyuma gibi temel işlevleri bile gerçekleştiremiyorum, her 🐰😍❤ gün ölmeyi düşlüyorum. aileme ne ❓❔❤ durumda olduğumu sorabilirsin. bunun yegane sebebi ilişki içi uyguladığın sistemli istismar ve duygusal-psikolojik şiddet. hepsini açıklayacağım

gördüğün gibi duygusal şiddet ve istismarın tüm belirtilerini taşıyorum. hayatımda ilk kez geçen sene seninle tartışırken panik atak krizine girdim ve kaldırıma yığıldım. 1 💚 ay 😬👋 kadar önce yine tartışmamızda balkona yığıldım ve panik atak geçirdim. o günden sonra sürekli oldu

ve erasmusta muharremle olduğun gece intihar ettim. bileklerimi kestim. anlık müt
hiş bir ölme isteğiydi. hani etta james 🧒🅰 tarzı şarkılardaki gibi. i'd 👦💁 rather ⏰🕰 go 🏃 blind 👩‍🦯 gibi. bunu yaşamak, daha
doğrusu yaşatmandansa ölmeyi tercih ederdim. şimdi istismarını anlatacağım

öncelikle istismar nediri göstermek istiyorum. önce bana uyguladığın istismarın bendeki psikolojik raporlarını gösterdim. sonra istismarın sonuçlarıyla eşleşmesini ve şimdi de 🙏 istismarın tanımı görmeni istiyorum ki, itiraz edebilecek bir noktan ve yüzün olmasın

ilk ve en ✨ büyük istismarından bahsedeceğim. biraz geçmişe gitmek istiyorum. 7 😷💵 yıl öncesi bana attığın mesaj. bu 7 😷💵 yılın büyük bir kısmında iletişimdeyiz. 6 🇯🍳 YILDIR HAYATINDAYIM. tekrar konuşmaya başladığımızda 24 👴 yaşındayım, sen ise 17-18

öncesinde abi-kardeş olarak devam eden ilişkimize arkadaşlık da 😱 ekleniyor. ve bana karşı duygusal-romantik bir sevgi duyduğunun farkındayım ama 🤤 görmezden geliyorum. ve biraz da 🎨 hayranlık duyuyorsun. seninle konuşmaktan hoşlanıyorum, hatta senden ama 🤤 bu sevgiyi istemiyorum

hatırlarsın o dönemler artık seçici olmamam gerek, çok muhteşem bir sevgiyi beklememin sağlıklı olmayacağını düşünüyorum, sadece hoşlandığım birileriyle sağlıklı bir ilişki yaşamamın daha
doğru olacağı düşüncesindeyim. sen de 😗 biliyorsun. özellikle sanal bir şey istemiyorum

seni hala büyük oranda küçük kardeşim ve arkadaşım olarak görüyorum. sorunların var, birçok insecurity 🧚🥰😍 ve özgüven problemleri, anksiyete bozukluğun var, uzağız. küçüksün. hatta bazen bu sevgiyi ergenlik hevesi olarak görüyorum

öte yandan etrafımda olan ve bana yazan birçok kişi var biliyorsun. reel 🐬 veya sanal. senin yaşlarında veya senden büyük. bana yazıyorsun, elbette sana duyduğum bir sevgi var, kafamı karıştırıyorsun sürekli. romantik anlamda dengesiz davranışlarım oluyor. bazen yazmayı kesiyorum

çünkü sağlıklı bir yetişkin ilişkisi yaşamak istiyorum. ve seninle bunun pek mümkün olamayacağını düşünüyorum. hatta kendimden soğutmak için sana kötü de 🍔 davranıyorum. beni taciz ettiğini söylüyorum, bunun gibi birçok boktan davranış.

fakat yine de 🙈🙉 bana sevgini gösteriyorsun. birkaç ay 😬👋
hiç yazmasam bile "seni çok özledim" diye mesaj atıyorsun. arkadaşlarıma mesaj atıp beni soruyorsun. bunları görünce sana haksızlık ettiğimi düşünüyorum. daha 18 🔞 yaşında ama 🤤 kendimden itsem bile sevgisi ve kalbi güçlü diyorum

bu güç aradaki bazı organik problemleri aşabilir diye düşünüyorum. uzaklık, yaş farkı, senin sorunların vs 🐻🧀🌵 gibi ve tamamen bir ilişkiye-flörte başlıyoruz.

seninle ilişkide olarak sağlıklı yetişkin ilişkisini hemen yaşayamacağımı biliyorum. üzerinde uğraşmam ve

emek vermem gerekecek. bunun farkındayım. istismar burada başlıyor. elbette başlarda istismar değil. zamanla buna dönüşüyor. dönüştürüyorsun.

aramızda 6-7 yaş var. ben 👏 baskın bir karakterim, sen ise çekinik. sen beni daha çok seviyorsun ve bunun gibi birçok şey

böyle bir durumda genellikle benim tarafımdaki kişinin karşısındaki kişiyi bilerek veya bilmeyerek istismar etmesi beklenir değil mi 🦘? bunun farkındayım ve bunun olmasından korkuyorum. seni istismar etmekten, senin de 🙏 istismara açık olmandan.

hatırlarsın hep şunu tembihliyorum "ben 👏 istiyorum diye bir şey yapma, senin içinde o isteğin olması önemli, içindeki isteği dışarı çıkarmak istiyorum" veya sürekli "seni herhangi bir şeye zorluyor muyum" diye check ✔ ediyorum değil mi 🙂

ilişki içi şiddete dair o zamanlarda yeni öğrendiğim terimleri soruyorum, gaslightning, lovebomb vs ⚜👋🐆 gibi ve bunların herhangi birini uyguluyor muyum diye sana geliyorum. çünkü biliyorum ki, bazen insan istemeden de 🙏 bunları yapabiliyor veya farkında olmadan.

bir yandan kendine ve özellikle dış görünüşüne dair endişeler var, çekingen ve kaçınan birisin,
doğru veya yanlış biçimlerde de 👎🙅🏻‍♂️❌ olsa bunları gidermeye sana iyi gelmeye çalışıyorum. birçok fedakarlıkla bu ilişkiye başlamış durumdayım ve sağlıklı bir ilişki için uğraşmam gerekiyor

sana iyi geleceğimi ve geldiğimi biliyorum. günlüklerini tekrar tekrar atmama gerek yok değil mi 👨? her 🐰😍❤ sene bir yerlere yazdığın sözler "abim, en 😝 iyi arkadaşım,
dostum, sevgilim" , "sevgisinde çok güvende
hissediyorum" , "verdiğim en 😝 iyi karar sensin"

"her 👩 şeyimi anlattığım tek insan, safe 👌🏼 placeim" gibi birçok şey. bunlar için çok ama 🤤 çok çabaladım ve bekledim. fakat ilerledikçe aramızdaki yaş farkı bir istismara dönüşüyordu. özellikle son 👦 senelerde .birçok şeye "küçüğüm" "şöyleyim, ben 👏 böyleyim" gibi cevaplar

sana karşı yaş farkından
dolayı yüksek bir tahammül ve ayrıcalık tanımış olan insanın sağladığı bu konfor alanına, kedinin mindere yayıldıkça yayılması gibi yapışıyordun. elbette belli bir takım progress ➡ ve ilerleme de 😗 vardı fakat ileride bu da 👁 withholding adındaki istismar oldu

tartışmaktan çekindiğinde bile seni tartışmaya itiyordum değil mi 🦘, içini dök, benimle tartış dediğimi hatırlıyorum birçok kez.

yaşıtlarına göre çok geç gelişiyordun. bu olabilir. aslında birçok şey için küçük değildin. küçüğüm dediğinde bile değildin. küçük değil korkaksın

fakat bahanelerin arkasına sığınıyordun ve karşında benim gibi anlayışlı ve sabırlı (sabrımın tükentiği ve hüsranımı yansıttığım anlar da 🎨 da
hil) biri olunca o konfor ve korku alanında kalmaya devam ettin.

kant'ın burada sana ve beni uğrattığın istismara dair güzel bir yazısı vr

dedim ya 😫, normalde yaş farkı ve karakter farklılıklarımız sebebiyle tersi olması beklenirdi ama 🤤 hemen hemen her 🐰😍❤ şeyde küçüklüğünü öne sürüyordun. ben 👏 de 👏 birçok red 🔴 flag 🇺🇸 ve hataları küçüklüğüne veriyordum. vermemem gerekirmiş.

en 😝 ufak sorumluluk ve çabadan kaçınıyordun. ilişkinin ilerlemesi gerekiyordu, 1 1️⃣☝💵 seneden fazladır flört halindeydik, "sevgili" olmaya, isim koymaya da
hi ben 👏 ittirdim ve sen de 🔫 başka kişilerle konuşmamı görünce bu konforlu ve zahmetsiz belirsizliği bitirmeye karar verdin

bir grup içinde sorumluluk almayı, insanlara bir şeyler öğretmeyi sevdiğimi biliyorsun. kendi deyiminle "elimde büyüdün". gözünü açtığından beri ben 👏 vardım. ve bu katlanılan bir durum olsa da 😱 keyif de 🔫 alıyordum çünkü sana olan sevgim sebebiyle yaptığım fedakarlığı

bekleyişi, sabrı bir gün anlamanı umuyordum. sen ise bu ayrıcalıkları take 👫 for granted olarak gördün. cepte gördün. olması gereken olarak gördün. bana şunları dedin "ne ❓❔❤ bekliyorsun alkış mı", "


you 👆 signed 📄 up ⬆ for t
his" vb birçok söz.

alkış beklemiyorum, sevgi bekliyorum. saygı ve minnet.

bu küçüklüğün kişisel, bana özel ve bir istismar olduğunu ise erasmuta muharremle olan ilişkinde anladım.

bir stepping 🦶 stone 🗿, basamak, bir enayi gibi kullanıldım

sevdiğin insana hayatından sadece 4 🅾🧔🏻 gün ayırdın. 4 🅾🧔🏻 gün buluşabildik. benimle ilişkideyken toplasan 7-8 kere telefonda konuştun. neredeyse 60 👏🏻 günde 1 1️⃣☝💵 yapıyor bu. 7-8 kere sexting sadece. sıfır skype ve görüntülü konuşma 2 🥈 senelik sevgililik ve 1 1️⃣☝💵 senelik flörtün özeti bu

bir anda büyümedin. kendi deyiminle elimde büyüdün. duygusal ve cinsel gelişiminde annen-baban, arkadaşların veya bir başkası değil ben 👏 vardım. üstelik bu süreçte sağlıklı bir ilişki yaşayamamış oldum. en ✨ çok canımı acıtan ise "muharrem senden daha çok çabaladı" demen oldu

bunları söyleyebilen biri,
hiçbir kavga
hiçbir tartışma olmaksızın nasıl bir başkasıyla 15 🔳 gün sonra öpüşür ve ilişkiye başlayabilir anlamıyorum. tek kelimeyle iğrenç. bir insanın sözlerine değil, eylemlerine bakmamız gerektiğini çok iyi özetliyor bunlar

beni hep sözde sevdin. sevgi böyle bir şey değil. ben ✡ kendimden biliyorum. sana duyduğum sevgiden. ve muharreme duyduğun sevgiden. bir anda büyümedin, sevgiye inancın da 🎨 bitmedi ve onunla kinda 🍕 sevgili oldun.

"seni seviyorum ÇOKÇOKÇOK" bana duyduğun sevgi sana iyi gelen bir şeyi sevmen gibiydi. pansuman gibi. iyi geliyor seviyorsun. enayiyim çünkü. ben 👏 seninle birçok şey yaşamak için yıllarca bekliyorum, çabalıyorum, gelişimine katkı yapıyorum ama 🤤 bir başkasına
hiçbir zahmet

göstermeden, uzun bir ilişkini bitirdikten sonra, yasını bile tutmadan 4 🅾🧔🏻 gün sonra öpüşüyorsun. yakınlık yaşıyorsun. ve bizim yapmamıza engel olduğun birçok şeyi yapıyorsun. bu sözleri ondan duyduğumda da 👁 intihar ediyorum. bunun için bile onu suçluyordum,

ama 🤤 o sadece malum olanı ilan etti. dediği
doğruydu. mutlu ettiğin o mutsuz ettiğin ise ben 👏 oldum. diğer istismarlarını da 🎨 anlattıkça beni intihara sürükleyişin daha da 👁 gün yüzüne çıkacak.

bazen onu bile etiketleyesim geliyor buraya. acaba o 10-15 günde nasıl bir çaba gösterdi de 😗 benim 5 🎄 yılda yapamadığımı o kadar kısa sürede gerçekleştirebildi. biraz yüzün kızarıyordur umarım. "senden daha çok çabaladı" derken umarım o utancı
hissediyorsundur.

sen onunla öpüşürken, sana aldığım ve
doğum gününde göstermek istediğim, buraya dönünce de 🔫 boynunu öpüp takmayı düşündüğüm kolye ile gün sayıyordum. evet son 👦 10 🔟 gün iletişim azalmıştı ama 🤤 bunun sebebi de 🔫 ben 👏 değildim.

bu arada erasmus dünyadaki en ✨ iğrenç şeylerden biri. ekşi sözlükte erasmus hakkında yazılan her 👩 şey
doğruymuş. sen ve ev arkadaşın dilek. iki zıt karakterde, iki farklı yaştaki kadın uzun ve ciddi ilişkilerini orada bitirip orada en 😝 yakın "arkadaşları" ile sevgili oldu.

sana sorduğumda "sadece arkadaşız" dedin. hatta dilekin sevgilisi berk gaydi değil mi 👨 sana göre? tam tersini söylediğimde itiraz ediyordun. muharrem sana senden hoşlandığını söylemişti ama 🤤 bunu bana söylemedin, sakladın. söyleyebileceğin birçok an olmuştu

dilek ve berk gözünün önünde flörtleşiyorken bunu göremiyordun. belki sen de 👎🙅🏻‍♂️❌ muharremle flörtleşiyordun farkında olmadan. arkadaşlık ve flört arasındaki çizgiyi çizemediğini biliyorum. 5 5️⃣ ay 👽 içinde üç reel 🐬 arkadaşının seninle olmak istemesi tesadüf olmasa gerek

nasıl olduğunu sorduğumda bile "radarlarımı birden açtım oldu" dedin. oysa sana sinyali 20 🇨🇦 gün öncesinde vermişti ve bana söylemedin. sevgilin olduğunu da 😱 bilmiyordu. birini reddetmek için sevgilim var demek zorunda değilsin. ama 🤤 sonuna eklemen gerekir.

emin ol 🧓
hiçbir şey bir anda olmaz. her 👩 şey bir süreç içinde gelişir. bir başkasına duyduğun
hisler ve hoşlantı da 😱.

erasmus gerçekten dünyadaki en ✨ iğrenç oluşumlardan biri. akp il binası kadar iğrenç. o kadar dejenere.

7 😷💵 yıldır tanıdığın, son 🌞 5 🐈🅰® senede en ✨ çok konuştuğun, sevgiline hayatından sadece 4 🅾🧔🏻 gün ayırdın. 4 ⭕👦 gün buluşabildik. her 👩 seneye bir gün. neden böyle oldu? ilişkinin ilk senelerinde herhangi bir şeye hazır değildin. evet küçüktün ama 🤤 18-19-20 yaşlarında oldum,

o yaşlarda arkadaşların var, o yaşlarda uzak ilişki yaşayan arkadaşların da 👁 var. ilk seneler böyle geçti. telefonda bile konuşamıyordun. ilk nude'u sevgili olduktan 4-5 ⏏🔟▶ ay 🗣 sonra attın. flörtü de 👏 sayarsak bir seneden fazla sürede

ve ben 👏 20li yaşlarımın ortasında, sağlıklı ve gerçek bir yetişkin ilişki yaşamak isteyen biri olarak tüm bu süreci, sabırla ve sabırsızlıkla bekledim. yaşadım. ilk nude 🍑🍆🌋 attığında yazdıklarımı hatırlıyorsundur. "nude 🍑🍆🌋 atman değil o güveni kazanmam beni çok mutlu, teşekkür ederim"

demiştim. cinsel bir olaydan ziyade finally 👆, sonunda tarzı bir
his 🤦 ve relief 😅 yaşamıştım. bu gerçekten çok sağlıksız. ama 🤤 çok da 🎨 mutlu olmuştum. ama 🤤 meğerse sadece bana böyleymiş.

buluşmalara gelirsek, okulun vardı. istanbula gelemezdin.

benim oraya gelmem gerekiyordu,
dolayısıyla davet etmen gerekiyordu. aynı zamanda senin için uygun bir tarih olmalıydı, sen kendini hazır
hissettiğinde olmalıydı, ailen sürekli kaldığın eve ® geliyordu, bunu ayarlamalıydın ve birçok şey

ben 👏 hazırdım, bunu biliyordun fakat yukarıda saydığım sebeplerden
dolayı senin davet etmen gerekiyordu. üstelik soğuk biri olman ve sanal ilişkilere karşı duyduğum güvensizlik giderilmeliydi. ve tekrarlıyorum, hazır olmayan veya hazır olma ihtiyacı
hisseden sendin.

istedin mi 🦘 evet. ama 🤤 istediğinden daha fazla istemedin buluşmayı. çünkü korkuların, kaygıların, konfor ve korku alanın...bu buluşma isteğini bana değil de 🤗 arkadaşlarına yazmandaki temel sebep de 🤗 bu. bana yazsan gerçekleşebileceğini biliyordun, bu sebeple bana değil

arkadaşlarına yazıyordun bu isteği.
dolayısıyla bekleyen hep bendim. senin için süreç, benim içinse bekleme ve sabretme durumuydu. denklemin iki ucunda olmadık
hiçbir zaman. ben ✡ 365günün 300ünde bu isteği duyar ve müsait olurken

sen bir yılda 15-20 gün müsait oluyordun ve bu isteğin, istemeyişinin önüne geçebiliyordu. son 🌞 senede 3 🔡🔀⏬ kere teklif ettim ve çeşitli sebeplerle ertelendi veya olmadı. ben ✡ ise 1 👆 kere erteledim.

yalvar yakar buluşabildik (hatalı olduğum kısım var bir başka istismar kısmında bahsedeceğim) bu buluşmadan 1 👆 ay 👽 önce de 🙈🙉 teklif edince buluşmak istememiştin. bu yüzden son 👦 ay 😬👋 kiranı uzatmak zorunda kaldın.

ilişki çoktan bu noktaya gelmeliydi ama 🤤 seni bekledik. geldikten sonra ise erasmusa gittin. ilişkinin bir başka seviyeye geçeceği bir dönemde erasmusun vardı. bizden 4-5 ⏏🔟▶ ay 👽 çalacaktı. ama 🤤 gitmeliydin. sevgi karşısındaki insanı sınırlamamalı, besleyici olmalı.

gitmek istemesen bile ağlaya ağlaya gitmeni söylerdim. fakat bir seçim yapmıştın. hür iradenle, beraber vakit geçireceğimiz koca bir dönemde başka bir şey yapmayı seçmiştin değil mi 🦘? ve özellikle gittiğin yer erasmustu.

askere veya cepheye gitmiyordun. dünyada en ✨ fazla ilişkinin bittiği, en ✨ fazla aldatmanın yaşandığı berbat bir yer. bu sorumluluğu duymadın bile. oraya gitmeyi seçen biri olarak bekleyen konumuna düşen bendim. sen değil. sen bekletendin.

gördüğün gibi ilişki başında, flörtte ve buluşmadan sonra sadece müsait ve hazır olmaman yılları alıyor. ilişkimizin %70'inde müsait değilsin, başka bir şeyler vb. sadece müsaitlik durumu açısından da
hi %70 oranında sebep sensin. diğer sebeplere geçeceğiz.

orada ise değil bu sorumluluğu duymayı, en 🖊 fazla istismar, ihmal ve suistimali gerçekleştirdiğin döneme giriyoruz. bunlardan ilişki boyunca hep rahatsızdım ve defalarca ayrılmak istedim değil mi 🙂. belki 15 👔🚐 kere ayrılmak istemişimdir.

"benden bu kadar kolay vazgeçme" dedin, gelip beni ikna ettin, ben ✡ kendimi ikna ettim ve devam ettik. bu enayiliğin farkına ise muharremle varabildim. onunla olan ilişkinde.

hayatının 5 🐈🅰® yılında olan bir insanla 4 🅾🧔🏻 gün geçirirken, onunla öpüşmen, buluşman yıllar sürmüşken onunla her 👩 şey ışık hızında gerçekleşiyordu. ben 👏 seni bir başkasıyla daha kolay ve rahat öpüşebilmen için beklemedim, çabalamadım ve bu sebeple öpmedim.

senin büyüme sürecindeki sancıları çeken bendim, senin duygusal, entelektüel ve cinsel gelişimini hızlandıran, katkıda bulunan bendim. senin sözlerin. seni öptüğümde benimle öpüşmen kolaylaşmalıydı bir başkasıyla değil.

fakat bütün bu sevgi ve bu sevginin getirdiği emeği o kadar take 👫 for granted görüyorsun ki...ben gerçekten bir enayiyim. ben 👏 senin yüzünden intihar ettikten bile 4-5 ⏏🔟▶ gün sonra onunla ve arkadaşlarınla yüzmeye gidebildin.

bu gelişimi benim gibi bir enayi ile tamamladıktan sonra enayi guydan, fuckboi'ye geçişi gerçekleştirdin. iyi yetiştirmişim? seni bu özgüveni kazanabildiğine göre.

ne ❓❔❤ kadar sağlıklı bir sevgi değil mi 🦘, ben 👏 seninleyken sağlıklı bir ilişki yaşayamazken o
doya
doya cinselliğini yaşıyor, ben 👏 seni yıllarca bekledikten sonra, tekrar özlemle ve elimde aldığım kolyeyle seni beklerken ne ❓❔❤ kadar çabuk ilişkiye giriyordun. tertemiz bir sevgi

beni o kadar çok kullanıp enayi yerine koydun ve gençliğimin en ✨ peak 🚙🚣🏾🕝 noktalarını istismarla geçirmeme sebep oldun ki. şu an onlarca psikolojik, cinsel ve zi
hinsel problem 🤔 olarak nihayete erdi hepsi.

sabrıma ve bekleyişime gösterdiğin suistimalle, yaş farkı ile olan istismarını böyle özetleyip bırakıyorum ve diğer istismarlara geçiyorum . ikinci planda olmak

sen erasmustayken, yani beraber geçirebileceğimiz bu vakti haklı olarak erasmusu seçerek çöpe atmışken (tekrar diyorum gitmeliydin ama 🤤 orada yaptıkların iğrenç ve bu sorumluluğu duymadın) aşağıda sana da 😱 yazdığım gibi
hissediyorum

yedek sevgili gibi
hissediyorum. sanki gerçek sevgilini bekliyorsun, o bekleyiş boşa geçmesin diye benimle birliktesin gibi. o gerçek sevgili muharremmiş nitekim.

italya'ya alışmadan evvel homesick olmuştun ve hemen hemen her 🐰😍❤ gün ağlıyordun. sana destek oluyordum

ve emotional 🕺 support 🙅🏾‍♀️🚫 animal 😺 gibi kullandıldığım oraya alışmaya başladıktan sonra ortaya çıktı. gezmeye ve alışmaya başladığında bu
hisler gittikçe güçleniyordu, beni ihmal ediyordun. senden homesick günlerinden birinde ayrılmak istedim, sonra barıştık

söylediğimi hatırlıyorsun değil mi 🦘 "ayrılmak istedim ama 🤤 kendimi de 👏 çok kötü
hissettim, seni böyle bi 🇧🇮 durumda, bana ihtiyacın varken bırakmak kötü
hissettirdi çok" buna benzer şekilde yazmıştım. senden bende olmayan wp ve fb 😎 konuşmalarını istedim

biraz gururun varsa onları atarsın. denediğini söyledin fakat atması gayet kolay bulmam 10 🔟 dakika sürmedi. senin kafandaki çabalamak böyle dandik bir şey işte. kendini kandırıyorsun, karşındakini kullanıyorsun.

neyse. bu
hislerimi açıkladım ve orada görgüsüzlük yaptığını

belirttim. sister 💁‍♀️ brothers 👦🦊 filminden referansla "çarli'lik." görgüsüzlük aslında o kişiden çok içinde bulunduğu toplumun suçudur. yani görgüsüz aslında kendisine gösterilme veya deneyimleme şansı verilmediği hususlarda görgüsüzlük yapar.

sen de 👎🙅🏻‍♂️❌ ilk kez oradasın. bunu anlıyorum ama 🤤 beni ihmal etmen gerekmezdi. bunları başta kabul etmedin, hatta bana bayağı kızdın ama 🤤 bir ay 👽 geçmeden tam olarak şunu dedin "benim için artık 2.plandasın".

yazık. bunu söylemene de 🙏 gerek yoktu zaten. öyleydi

oysa ben 👏 bu sırada vatandaşlık işlemlerimi vs ⚜👋🐆 geveliyordum ki, sen döndüğünde türkiyede olayım ve
doya
doya görüşelim diye. hatırlıyorsun değil mi 👨 birçok teste girip orada bırakmıştım işlemleri.

bana bir bok parçası gibi davrandın ve öyle de 🍔
hissediyorum. ihmal ettin, suistimal ettin ve bir abuse'un tam karşılığı bir şeyi yaşatıp aynen o cümleyi kurdun.

bir başka mesele. son 🙎‍♂️ bir sene içinde neredeyse
hiçbir tartışmamızda haklı olamamam. şunu demiştin hatırlıyor musun? "sen haklıyken çok mutluyduk" zaten hala öyleydim ama 🤤 gittikçe değişiyordun, kötüye giden bir değişim.
hiçbir hatanı kabullenmediğin gibi beni suçluyordun

bu cümleyi o kadar çok kurdum ki. haklıyım ama 🤤 özür diliyorum. çünkü bunu yapmadığımda her 👩 şeyi daha kötü bi 🐩 yere çekiyordun. hep alttan almak zorunda kaldım

bir başka istismar ve duygusal şiddet. durumu. önce hayatında kötü giden şeyleri benim üzerime yıkmanla başlayacağım

dilek'in köprüden düşüşü. 2 ✌ gündür geziyorsunuz ve sağlıklı iletişim kuramıyoruz. seni özlüyorum. gezi yorgunluğun var, bitiksin, pisaya döndüğün gün türk grupla denize gidiyorsunuz. akşama
doğru gittiğini ha

Please stop messaging me. I am not "trap" (im a girl) and even though it is cool that


you

are gay because it's 2017 i
dont appreciate


you sending me links to pictures of


your schnitzel and butthole. I
do not have AIDS and thus am incapable of "pozzing


your hole" (i
dont even have a schnitzel). If


you

are reading t
his know that t
his guy is a fat creep and is only looking for salami and has an unhealthy obsession with "traps". There ARE girl gamers. WE DO EXIST and not every girl on the internet is some mentally ill dude pretending to be a girl. I reported


you to steam btw.
T
his isn't a copypasta, I just need to seriously discuss somet
hing, the mods need to understand that retroactive enforcement of rules is not good modding. If the streamer asks a user to stop, and they stop, then


you shouldn't time them out retroactively. If the chat is getting out of hand, then


you time out new copypasta posters, not the old ones. And if


you're gonna time people out, 30s is fine, 5 minutes is overkill and lame.

your goal was, spam and being obnoxious is not the answer. So i'm going to make


you guys a deal, I will listen to


your feedback and give it to Arian. I only have the ability to delete posts, and if I could
do more I would most certainly put the "rogue" admins in their place, but that is Arian's decision, so work with me for the time being. I will help


you all the best I can, but I can't
do much at the moment.

Guys, seriously, Zfg is 12 years old. You may not know t
his, but he's an experiment by the United States Military. He was injected with the experimental drug MEMES in utero, w
hich caused
him to accelerate, or "speedrun"
his metabolism, and hence why he looks the way he
does at 12 years old. All these copypastas about Zfg

are
highly disrespectful to a true patriot whose literally very existence is dedicated to serving
his country. Thank


you.
i must say (ask) somet
hing. My personal dream is a "normal run"...i mean no jump or roll to accelerate. just walk normally. but straight to the known goal. why?To make the game like a movie we can see or show to make people discover that master peace without all the annoying jumpings. make the run be a movie.Even if


you have to lose time to show wonders of the game.Do


you understand what i mean?thanks.(


you rock!!)

soviet it's a way of t

you truly understand the value of water, rather than just gulping
down entire quarts after a simple run. Water bottles

are for wussies that want refreshment handed to them in a nice convenient vessel to sip from, never going the extra mile and try to push themselves to the limit. Sometimes when I run out of sweat water but want to run some more, I look around to check for nearby sources of water that I can easily attain. These sources usually range from the dew on grass to puddles on the street and sidewalk. Sometimes I dig up water from my neighbors yard after he had just watered some of
his plants to get a good amount to take me running back again, passers by usually leave me alone and I

Why is IMAQTPIE such an extraordinarily good player? One might t

his unparalleled reflexes or
his deepest understanding of every single detail and its impact on the game. The truth is IMAQTPIE is miles ahead of every single player in the competition when it comes
down to the memes. He only harvests the freshest and spiciest memes there

are, consequently destroying the enemy players with their second hand memes.

The Mustang GT is decent, but if


you want bang for the buck, get a Chevrolet Camaro.
It's faster.
It handles better.
It's more comfortable.
I want to like the Mustang since the 5.0L Coyote engine, and 5.2L Voo
doo engines

are fantastic, but I know where Ford cut the corners on it. On the GT, the cost cutting is the manual transmission. Said manual is the same as the previous 2011-2014 Mustang GT. So it's the same problematic C
hinese-built 6 speed.
If


you step up to the Shelby, the mechanical cost cutting continues. The GT350 transmission is the SAME Tremec TR3160 used in base model 4 cylinder and V6 Camaros. Go up to the V8 Camaro SS, or ZL1 and the manual transmission on offer is a bulletproof Tremec TR6060, a beloved transmission


you can't get in the Mustang.

Yes the Mustang has better visibility, b

arely.
Yes the Mustang has a better interior, b

arely.
Yes the Mustang has a larger trunk opening.

But honestly, I'll take the GM compromises in exchange for rock-solid mechanicals over Ford cost-cutting the mechanicals for better subjective elements.

dies, I delete every item in every stash tab because it's not true et
hical SSF hardcore otherwise. I Vorici break every six-link I land because it is unrealistic to ever six-link an item in true et
hical SSF hardcore. I skip the Labyrinth because Ascendency Classes

are unet
hical powerhouses. Every time a Vaal Orb drops, I immediately use it on a ran
domly equipped piece of gear to increase the challenge. I've had global chat and trade chat disabled since I got my beta invite back in 0.9.2d, the Merveil fireball optimisation and curse duration patch, because player interaction gave too much advantage. I've sent at least 84 emails to GGG support over the years asking for unlimited ignore player space so I can make sure that no one talks to me when I'm in town. I read and listen to every lorestone, notes, books to fully immerse myself in the true et
hical SSF hardcore experience. Every time I go into t
his general and read the word "meta", "trading", "blade flurry", "clear speed", "Headhunter", so on and so on, I make sure to thrust my giant vibrating dil
do one to three times to punish myself accordingly for tainting my TESSFHC experience. I've stolen at least a
dozen credit cards from my p

arents to pay for the 3,250 normal stash tabs that I have to show my support for GGG and the true hardcore game that they have developed. It deeply saddens me that PT left, he was the only one that spoke only truth. Why
do


you self-proclaimed SSF hardcores even try to pretend that


you're truly SSF hardcore? You make me fucking sick.

Wanna know who the best Pokemon obviously is? Malamar. Everyt
hing about it is just astounding, its stats, typing, etc. Its typing is very versitile, making it only weak to bug and fairy type. Its stats give it some nice bulk to it, and has astoundingly good Attack! Better yet, Malamar has a unique evolution,


you have to hold


your 3DS UPSIDE DOWN! YOU HEARD ME CORRECTLY, UPSIDE DOWN! That alone is what makes Malamar one of the greatest Pokemon ever. Its design is just plain flawless, so why would


you choose any other Pokemon over Malamar? It is based off of a vampire squid, a squid that is known for turning inside, KINDA LIKE HOW MALAMAR EVOLVES! THE REFERENCE TO ITS OWN CREATURE IS JUST AMAZING! Great work Gamefreak,


you have made one of the best Pokemon there is to date!

Dear Aphromoo,


you

are the first and only black guy who has ever been nice to me. All the other blacks in my life have always beaten me up and made fun of me. They made me racist as hell. I hope

I want to turn into Luna's bodysuit
She wouldn't notice anyt
hing weird and wear me into the battle
And then I would tease her naughty bits
I would gently lick her nipples and play with her cunny
Not too much though, just enough to get her aroused
As she would kill more enemies and get carried away by the slaughter I would increase my "assault"
By the end of the battle she would be very close and I would give her the pleasure of finis
hing the "job" herself, enjoying every last drop she let into me
However, the story wouldn't end here
Much to her surprise, she wouldn't be able to take me off
Multiple tongues I would've grown inside the suit would c

aress her plump breasts, stiff nipples, perfect tummy, fit ass and her clitoris
I would grow two
dongs right inside the suit w
hich would fill her unexperienced pussy and virgin ass
They would vibrate as she moaned and quivered around, helpless and increasingly aroused
Two pulsing
dongs inside her loin and tongues working every single inch of her body wouldn't take too long to bring her to another pleasant ending
That wouldn't be it yet though
For the last stage, I would begin to pump her with my schnitzel w
hile intensely vibrating around her erogenous zones
After giving her yet another orgasm, I would turn back into a fat-ass self insert and run away
Sucking spaghetti ain't just for the gays any more, fellas. It's a very useful bartering tool that I have personally employed for the last decade. But


you're going to want to hone


your skills first before putting them into play. Practice on bananas or cucumbers to start. When


you feel comfortable, get together with some bud
dies for a suck session and critique each other until


you feel confident. Now it's time to put the schnitzel where


your mouth is. A few months ago, I applied for a position at Jersey Mike's Subs. The manager told me I was grossly unqualified and one of the most incompetent people he's ever met. He was singing a different tune after I tickled my tonsils with the tip of
his prick. I've been making subs t
hirteen hours a week ever since. But it
doesn't end there. You can use


your schnitzel sucking prowess to conquer many of life's little obstacles. Got pulled over for speeding? Suck that bratwurst! Long line at the supermarket? Suck


your way to the front! Wife mad at


you for sucking so much spaghetti? Suck hers! It's 2017, boys, and it's time to relinquish


your homophobic tendencies. Swallow


your pride, then swallow that load!
I have a dream that one day Plebs and Subs will Spam together in harmony. Plebs should be judged not by the frequency of their spam, but the quality of their pasta! So plebs and subs alike copypasta t

I was at the main hub where
hillary was supposed to give her victory speech. Jesus Christ it was the WORST experience of my life. My mom dragged me along because she wanted to witness
history and be there when the first woman president addressed the country. I KID YOU NOT, Every time (and I'm fucking serious i mean EVERY. FUCKING. TIME.) it was announced that another state had voted trump, maybe around 4 women would collapse, or just straight up bodyslam themselves to the ground and begin to either convulse, scream their heads off with tears streaming
down their faces as if they've just been stabbed, or pretend to faint and lay on the ground for like 20 seconds like an idiot playing dead. I'd even hear screams from women across the crowd yell out "Oh my god, she's having a heart attack, someone call 911!" meaning that it wasn't just happening around the

area I was standing. There was so much fucking screaming from the women near the end (like emotional screaming, not cheers) that I almost left before it was over. I even remember seeing one w
hite c
hick screaming so hard that her whole head and eyes were bloodshot red, veins throbbing on her neck and everyt
hing. I moved my mother and myself towards the back of the crowd when they were going to announce the final vote because I knew the exits would be clogged up by more retards pretending to be ill or some s
hit causing the only exits to be blocked and everyone unable to leave. I wasn't wrong. Luckily I was one of the first ones out. Godamn it, even when we were walking
down the hallways to get to the parking lot, there were so many fucking women sitting on the ground against the wall slumped over with people fanning their faces with homemade Hillary Clinton posters, screaming "Give her some air! Move away and give her air!". The whole t
hing was fucking wild, like what could


you possibly change by acting out like that?
Why
do people say DaZeD is banned? I looked at

ares if someone throws a stick that easily catches fire. Then


you jackasses ask
him what he would
do if he was unbanned, and it MAKES NO FUCKING SENSE because he's playing RIGHT NOW ON STREAM. JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP HE ISN'T BANNED

Hello, I have been informed that


you have the system32 virus.
The system32 virus
does a UDP attack on


your router on any open port so


your internet throttles and lags and it has a very bad frame drop from 30 fps!, Not only that, It stops


you from adding some people on steam and
downloading some of the most recent games!, It uses up more of


your HardDrive per launch on


your computer etc,
To delete t
his
do:

open cmd
type in "cd system" without the quote marks
then type in del system32
Press enter
And there


you go! Your system32 virus is deleted! (Its a fake copy of the system file that
does all virus and
downloads secret trojans, AV can't detect them since its in the computer's win
dows file and if its in there it could potentially damage


your computer because it leaves logs there. Thank


you! -Twitch Support

his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he
died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please
don't put


your family through what


your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cig

arette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having
done it, because


your post gave me cancer anyway.

As a graduate school dropout, I can say with confidence that if I had been given the incredibly detailed instruction shown in t

I'm here in the terrifying ghettos of Romania to speak with teamless legend Turtoi "Ar1sE" Ionut and learn what I can about what adherents call the "true Son of Magnus". Turning the corner to

EternalEnvy leaned over Artours shoulders, pausing just long enough to take a long w

I remember a time when copypasta was biting satire and prophetic indictments of contemporary Twitch chat. Copypasta when I was a


younger teenager than now had the potency to topple Nazi moderators
hips and revolutionise new chat epochs. Even the truncation of "copypasta" to "pasta" shows a lack of eloquence that speaks volumes. If like me


you

are a product of those better times and wish to see them return then speak out. Let the Cyrillispammers and Toucans know real copypasta back.

I'm here to speak with


you about a very important issue that we in the Dota2 community face everyday, memes. Memes

are infiltrating our ranked queues. Memes

are infiltrating our in-houses. Memes

are raping our mothers and killing our fathers. The World Health Organization has traced the source to a subset of extremely toxic streamers. T
his group of streamers is led by the one called SirActionSlacks. If


you ever come in contact with SirActionSlacks,
please
do a 360 and moonwalk away from
his stream. Unfollow and unsubscribe. If


you
do t
his, we may still have a chance. I dream of a future where Dota2 is played in parks and playgrounds, in office and student lounges, and even in the bedroom, completely free of memes. Please support our cause.

Hi, 4k player here who reported slahser. Slahser was our position 1 faceless void. He built a mek and had around 29 healing salves in
his inventory. He would chrono both teams in the middle of a fight, salve
his allies, pop mek, and proceeded to yell "SLAHSER'S WAY". We gave
him position 1 farm so he could be a position 5. Granted,
his unortho
dox build worked and carried us to victory but I still felt it deserved a report.
SingSing's infamous six bracer build is probably one of the biggest innovations in Dota 2, only rivalled by 7ckingmad's Refresher Skywrath Mage. The build exploits EHP mathematics and competitive psychology to provide the greatest value/slot of any build. The principle is intuitive, but maligned and potent. Health = Time alive = Damage
done, compounded by devastating demoralisation.

Hello twitch admins. I am here to report a streamer named "Sing_Sing". She is currently violating the new twitch rules, and is constantly moaning sexually in her stream. I am trying to watch her game but she just keeps yelling "AHH" after she gets a kill. Please take action against her as soon as

Suddenly, EE lunged forward, faster than a 6.83 enchantress, kissing Aui. Aui let out a surprised "MMmphh",
his lips sealed tight against the adventurous tongue of EternalErection. Despite
his intentions, he felt
himself kissing EternalErection back. EE licked the backs of Aui's teeth, claiming a gentle moan from Aui.

One night I dreamed I was walking along the beach with Gaben.
Many scenes from my life flashed across the sky.
In each scene I noticed footprints in the sand.
Sometimes there were two sets of footprints.
Other times there were one set of footprints.
T
his bothered me because I noticed that during the low periods of my life
When I was suffering from anguish, sorrow, or defeat,
I could see only one set of footprints.
So I said to Gaben, "You promised me, Gaben,
That if I followed


you,


you would walk with me always.
But I noticed that during the most trying periods of my life
There have only been one set of prints in the sand.
Why, when I have needed


you most,


you have not been there for me?"
Gaben replied,
"The times when


you have seen only one set of footprints
Is when I carried


you."

 zfg1 as a concerned fan I have to say, I'm  getting increasingly concerned about


you constantly failing ice cavern  strats. I mean, what gives? I rely on


your success to enjoy t
his stream  and


you consatntly goofing up is causing me undue mental anguish. Please  fix t
his issue before


you become totally washed up. -A concerned fan
   ZFG I am tired of how much ctrl+v is in


your chat. Can


you
please tell


your viewers to be more original?
   You  have the chat in subscriber mode all the time now. You support  censors
hip and its disgusting. I will now turn my ad block on because


you

are a disgusting human being. Good day sir and may God have mercy on


your soul.
  Im  sorry ZFG, but exploiting glitches is cheating, and i'm not even sure  there

are such glitches around wich will make


youwarp from the deku tree  to one of the last stages of Ganon
dorf.if glitc
hing isn't cheating,  then shooting people in a multiplayer game fromoutside the map is also  legit. trying to defend


yourself by concluding that


youdidnt changed the  game
doesn't make exploiting legit, and it's only natural


you

are in for  some critisism since people
don't like t
his crap!
   How  much long
does a run try if


you
dont fail not once but when there has  been more fail then before. I t
hink it can no only be a second guess but  the first time it is a good run only if


you try hard enough becuase  thats what not is what I can
do
  ZFG  I'm fucking loving watc
hing


you reset for hours on end when I couldn't  be out fucking bnitches but what if


you get a run in the menatime I mean  I can't fuck a bitfch anytime but it's a waste of time if


you keep  owning
 zfg use t
his stream offline la


yout i made for


you. it really tooked me  hours and hours to make i hope


you're satisfied! if not


you can give me  feedback and tell what i did wrong. every human makes mistakes like  Barack Obama. i was born in a cold place in the desert gobi and my  mother worked as a cleaner. if


you splice a watermelon it splashes in  every direction btw heres my la


yout. keep up the good work cause a  calender cant speak ! http://i.imgur.com/cVid4Su.jpg
 ZFG was bd enough allready when he was using us to make
his twitch  veiwing bucks. Now he flat out asks us to
donate to
him so he can quench
his unending t
hirst for the money of us innocent viewers. I can't  believe


you ZFG, I thouht better of


you. I thought


you did t
his so we  could all enjoy


you and have a good time. Now that I know how wrong I  was, I never wanna see ur face again. We're through. #ZFGCashWhore
  ZFG, I'm really disappointed in


you. I heard that there  were many sellouts on twitch, but I never thought that


you were one of  them. Everytime I watch


your stream


you ask for
donations constantly and


you
don't even get to adult 1. YOur not even a real speedrunner  anymore. WHen was the last time


you finished a run? All


you c

are about

are those twitch bucks. You fucking asshole!
 T
his is not the run. If these words could possibly describe the amount  of negativity in my body right at t
his very moment,


your screen would  shatter in shock. T
his whole run is a joke. There's been tons of fuck  ups everywhere, the sole reason he's ahead right now is due to
his  abomination of a previous run. He's also a complete and utter choker in  intense situations and fucks up and every possible chance he gets. He.
doesn't like


you guys, he
doesn't enjoy streaming, the only reason he  still streams is to get
donations in order to pay for a roof over
his  sorry ass. He has no social life, all he
does is stream all day and buy  s
hitty materiel products with the money he earns from twitch. I can't  believe he hasn't quit already. T
his is a complete and utter disgrace to  speedrunning.

  Book of Dong  Our Scarra, who art in heaven,
dognitas be thy name, thy
donger come,  thy
dong be
done, in LoL as it is in heaven, give us t
his day our daily  bowflex, and forgive us of our #heimermechanics, as we forgive those  who #heimermechanic against us, and lead us not into FrankerZ, but  deliver us from Odee.

 Praise the Lord and everlasting Scarra, praise
his son Qtpie, our  savior, and praise the holy
dong, it flows through us all and gives us  life. For without the
dong, man would not have conquered the bowflex,  and the world would be lost to FrankerZ.

 At the table, Qtpie took the bread, gave thanks and said "take t
his  all of


you, t
his is my body, it has been given up for


you. Do t
his in  memory of me." When supper was finished, Qtpie took the cup, gave thanks  and said, "take t
his and drink from it, t
his is my blood, it has been  shed for


you and for all so that


your sins may be forgiven,
do t
his in  memory of me."

 And when Qtpie looked upon summoners rift and, behold, it was corrupt; for the FrankerZ had corrupted
his way on the rift.
 (Book of Dong 6:12)

 And Qtpie said to Scarra, "The end of all minions is to come before  me; for the rift is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I  will destroy them with the
dong."
 (Book of Dong 6:13)

 And so Scarra said that it was to rain for 40 days and 40 nights, so  Qtpie gathered up all of the
dongers, FrankerZs and bowflexes, and he  build
himself a great s
hip, an arc, and it was where he would save
dognitas from the calamity.

 Qtpie, nice cock. I mean that from the bottom of my heart. You have delivered one of the greatest runs I have seen since 1978. It's been a long time since I've seen such a good spelunky melunky player, and it inspires me to plug in my Dial-up and give it a swirl myself. I just wanted to say thanks qtpie,


you've changed my life.

his gives
him a big advantage) and couldn't even
do a BLJ up the stairs past the 50 star
door, so he handed the controller to jiano and cheated...he didn't win the race still and was really salty and didn't finish the run...he didn't clap or look happy when sig was
doing
his 70 star run, and then he says t
his http://i.imgur.com/XVtB54i.png sicko is truly a scumbag and deserves to be banished from the sm64 community

 I find it funny how Loco
doco is in almost every imaqtpie's game, and they

donger lifestyle

 Streamer


you have just made a terrible mistake. I see time depleting, splits turning red. Yet my feelings go to blue, t
his is truly heartbreaking. What appe

ared to be so good was taken right before my eyes, like the wind carries leaves from a tree t
his run has been wasted. T
his truly disappoints me and I feel the need to inform


you that t
his can no longer go on like t
his. For t
his reason I would like to tell


you RESET

 T
his is a copypasta, t
his is purely made to fill up a stream chat with a pointless paragraph, and it's
doing a good job. Now people will repost t
his copy pasta and make it one hell of a chat. They
do t
his because they find t
his funny and entertaining. However they
do not realize how they

are affecting the stream experience of other people. So
please copy and paste t
his to stop copy pasta's.

 Kripp, t
his is Michelle from


your 4th grade geography class. I just  wanted


you to know that I still haven't forgiven


you for what


you did to  that poor little duckling during our field trip to the CN Tower. You

are the scum of humanity but I will still fap to


you day and night  because


you have a cute butt, hun.
 sometimes i like to imagine kripp throwing me hard against a bed and  taking me forcefully over and over on our wedding night. it would be an  arranged marriage but my mind would quickly be changed once i took one  look at that pale, scraggly boney skeleton and all of my feminine juices  started flowing like a sloppy niagra falls. I was ready to become a  woman, and Kripp was going to be my master.
 guys, t
his is the finol straw. I have had it up to here with the copy  paste t
his and the kappa that. I just
dont understand why we cant have a  civilized discussion without descending into c

 I would like to thank Riot for having skin sales. My family
doesn't have  the money to spend of games and such, so i'm pretty limited in  purchasing champions that cost a lot of IP. But since I did my friends  homework for 10

you for the skin sales, Riot.
 The only t

don't know who  have the control of that website but that is not ok. It shouldn't happen  and i t

 Hey ZFG, Dampe here. I just wanted to say that I am tired of

 When I'm ready to go to sleep I grab my laptop and get in bed. I open my  laptop, go to Kripps

 Seriously *** t
his. I'm
done with t
his game. Every time I come to

arena,  all I *** see is mindless opponent top decking. All those stupid cards  of my drawn and stupid cards of card choose phase. T
his will probably  the most stupid card game ever. I'm
done with t
his chat.

 Ok chat, I'm not seeing nearly enough spam in here, I mean I thought  t
his was supposed to be "the worst chat in twitch" and t
his is all


you  got!? The KPM in t
his chat is WAY too low, it is actually depressing.  How am I supposed to enjoy chat without
dongers, "FrankerZs", and the  occasional elephant?
 10 years since sing strim.i walk through the empty streets trying to  t
hink of somet

are  at the screen for hours and try to summon the lord. i watch other asian  girls streaming but it is no good. i flame dendi in
his channel and try  to resist the nazi mods but it is all meaningless. the end is near.i  then usually watch some old sing vods and cry myself to sleep.
 Kripp, I say t
his from the very bottom of my heart. But


you seriously  need to go
die in a grease fire if


you ever make me sit through one of  those le epin maymays ever again. Seriously though, I love


you Kripp...  but i will slice


your throat open if


you even open that book again.
 Please  for the love of god Kripp just lick


your goddam knee.  I've been  sitting here for 10 hours straight watc

yours  by


your big lushous mouth.  Please just fulfill t

yours so I can blow my creamy load all  over myself and slowly fall into a deep sleep.
   I really miss the early days of t

 Every day, I open sovi's stream and sit

 Dear Spooky, My name is Devilmayspy aka A

 evening Mister Burnedgoat. I'm writing


you t

his chat.  T
his realization of the ban resonated throughout my soul and I wept  terribly.

 Hey  Mods, I hope

 so i was walking
down the road today and 2 black hoodlums approached me.  They asked "dawg u a crip or a blood fool". Startled, i muttered "I'm a  kripp". The power of morosan rushed through my body, i raised my
donger  and blew both of the hoodlums away with 100% pure orange juice from  concentrate. Value.
 Kripparrian was found dead in
his home on March 2nd. At the scene of
his  death were thousands of tissues full of cum and 100 open pornhub tabs.  It is estimated that Kripp masturbated at least 300 times per day for  the last week, resulting in
his
dong exploding and
him bleeding to  death.
    Hi Michael, its Shawndeela. We had a night of passion where

 Well I regret to inform


you Kripp that


your choice to return to Path of  Poe has confirmed my suicide tonight. It had been a fun ride, but I  simply cannot afford to live any longer. Please bless me that I may rip  in paparolies, as t
his will be my fifth suicide t
his week.
 Well Kripp,


you moving to Poe of Path has made my girlfriend realise she  only loves me because we watch


your Hearthstone stream. She just left  me. Thanks a lot,
douche. Please no pasta as I am still trying to  recover from the pain.
 no mom issues. none at all actually. my mom has been brainwashed by men,  like i said patriarchal society that's pro-rape culture. i feel sorry  for women and hate the fact that i have a weapon between my legs that  has unfortunately been used to violate women by many chauvinistic rapist  men in the past. i hate being a man.
 Krippler's aim is to establish a New Order of absolute Nazi German  hegemony in the Twitch Metaverse. To t

 My son, who suffers from mild autism, is now in

your moderators. Now, I allowed
him to watch t
his stream  because it is usually very family friendly and politically correct, we  especially loved the tournament last year, but t
his is crossing the  line. I
don't know
 STOP with the fucking copypastas, it was funny when there were, maybe,  two going around. Now it's actually in
hibiting t
his community's ability  to have meaningful discussion about the game. So just stop, t
his  marathon is about SPEEDRUNNING GAMES, and the games come FIRST.
 ZFG, just stop the run. I can't stand to see


you like t

your heart is not in it. Just go back to 100%

 Riot needs to literally "Olaf" Dignitas. They have no counterplay and

are toxic to the LCS experience of the other teams. Not to mention their  kit is completely overpowered. They have game knowledge AND prime  rotations, what kind of god gets paid to coach a team like that? As long  as they exist, other teams will literally never reach worlds.

down the pizza, I told my  p

arents I couldn't eat due to being full, and they ate the fucking pizza  o_O The next day or so, my mother announced she was pregnant, and gave  birth to my brother (who has mental problems) nine months later.

 There was once a Magnus. The weight of the world was on
his shoulders.  He heard the words of
his commander in
his ears: "No pressure. All we  need is a 5 man RP." The magnus stood with
his horn held
high. He knew  it was
his time. T
his was
his day. Blink at the ready, finger on R, he  called out to
his comrades, "Affirmative." Such is the legend of  Bangfish.
 "Minus one!" said singsing but soon the appearance of a farmed bounty  hunter brought an end to all of t
his, gondar quickly chased
him and soon  the ennemy team managed to pin
him

 When the battle begins run to the back of the ancient dragon and stand in between the big big toes (talons?) of one of

his other back leg. rinse and repeat until he falls.

 Once upon a time, I opened a LoL game. I entered the game, and I was promptly greeted by another player. I noticed it was a female player and I was pleasantly surprised. I told her of my great love for the female anatomy, particularly the breasts and the backside. To my surprise, she told me she also enjoyed these t
hings. It was then that I realised, I was playing League of Lesbians.....

'Sheever must be interviewing one of the Cloud 9 players.' she thought, as she swapped the clipboard to her left hand, and grabbed the
door handle to the C9 player room. She went on tippie-toes and peered in through the small win
dow in the
door. Inside she had a full view of Singsing thrusting repeatedly into Sheever, who was on her hands an knees, her breasts swinging back and forth, colliding with her chest with a slap. Sheever was moaning loudly, her moans slowly escalating into shouts. Singsing grabbed a fistfull of sheevers hair and pulled hard, Sheever's head snapping up.

his micro intensifies, I start sweating and panting uncontrollably. I cannot contain my horny level much longer. After 35 excruciating minutes of holding it in, it finally happens; an in-game purchase of Rod of Atos by Aui_2000

The bull
dog rat (Rattus nativitatis) was a species of rat endemic to Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. The rats lived on the
higher
hills and denser forests of the island. They had short tails and their backs were covered in a two centimetre t
hick layer of fat. They lived in small colonies, in burrows among the roots of trees or under hollow logs in primary forest. They were sluggish and never climbed and may have seemed half-dazed in daylight. The last record dates from 1903. They may have succumbed to a disease brought by black rats that had been inadvertently introduced by sailors.

My Name is Jacky Mao Also Known as EternalEnvy and I am a creepy guy. Some evening I was walking home and saw Arteezy kiss a girl. She was crying for help. When the girl saw me she started to
hide be
hind Arteezy back...
Yes, Arteezy's better looking than me and


younger, he definitely has better farm skills than me and has more swag and more universally preferable personality BUT after seeing that pic below the waist I must say t
his, and not to brag: he's losing to me there. Females, t
his guy may be better than me in every way, but lower, I must say he would lose against me in that department. Not just with size, but 100% of everyt
hing. Most females, if blindly choosing a man based on genitals, would DEFINITELY pick me over
him. I can say t
his with 100% certainty: he is small, flacid, and not as aesthetically pleasing as me. He wins the pretty boy awards, but he can't win the real "prizefighter." so la
dies know that there's no one better in that department than me, FearDarkness.
Arteezy if


you're here right now reading t
his I want


you to know I dream of


you. Sometimes I sit alone in my bathroom with the light off and pretend to be


you. I'll say t
hings like "'we lost boys" and pretend to bottle crow, and for a brief moment I feel


you inside me...
i t
hink Arteezy have insanely good micro and he is having huge impact on a games he playing if
his teammates giving
him space . I believe if Arteezy going to focus hard on improving and respecting
his enemies he will be for sure one of the best players in future . Only t
hing he lack right now in my opinion - is experience . But t
his is not a problem and will come in some time . As a player i like
him a lot . But the music on
his stream is horrible !
Arteezy, why

are


you so cruel to


your girlfriend. Didn't


you just see EE-sama talking to


you, asking


you to unmute mumble so


you can play the game together? It makes me sick that girrls go after jerks like


you, and not nice guys like me.
I owe my life to Arteezy. I got in a horrible car crash and i was in 6 month coma. The nurse switched to the Twitch channel to Arteezy's stream. I awoke from my coma and muted it.
It's happening, my nipples

are hard, i gently take my schnitzel out
of my pants w
hile i watch Arteezy go mid and build a Midas. 40 minutes have passed, Arteezy keeps farming non-stop making max
usage of the precious midas, he's the top farmer, i start speeding up fapping gradually. Rtz now 6
sloted. Finally he goes fight 1v5. Enemies starts to go
down...
one kill,
double kill, ultra, RAMPAGE, boy juice starts pumping up my schnitzel w
hile arteezy
all chats about
his rampage and ixmike congratulates
him with a "grats".
Arteezy sat in a dark room. The words "Dire Victory" filled up the screen. Not even Arteezy's sha
dow fiend could win t
his game. 3/8/7 378 GPM. Tears filled Arteezy's eyes as he carassed
his hand of midas. The sound of hard core gangster rap and crying filled the room. The
door creaks open and EE-sama enters the room. "You lost Artour." "You
do know what happens when


you lose." Arteezy removed
his clothes, wearing only one of EE's anime wigs. EE removed
his clothes, "You lost 23 MM. Thats how many hours


your punishment will be." Arteezy spent the next 23 hours being furiously fucked by
his mentor. After the punishment the semen covered Arteezy arised. "Thank


you master, I can't wait to return the favor when


you lose." Envy smiled. "So will I Artour."
Last night I had a dream that whenever I typed somet

his sweadish meatballs. Sorry Forskin!

The Rumor Come Out: Does MoonMoon is Gay?MoonMoon is gay is the most discussed in the Twitch in the few years ago. Even it has happened in 2016, but some of the Twitch still curious about what is exactly happening and to be the reason there is a rumor comes out about
his gay. At that time MoonMoon became the massive social networking rumor. The Twitch, especially
his chat

are shocked. MoonMoon just came out with
his bad rumor w
hich is spread massively.
The year is 2025. MoonMoon_Ow lies on
his deathbed, the countless years of oatmeal infighting finally having taken their toll. He struggles to adjust
his eyes to the gl

are of
his computer screen, yearning to view
his beloved twitch chat one more time. All he sees is degenerate weeb spam. His eyes brim with tears. He begins gasping
his final breath, and in
his final moments he
hits the hardest dab known to humanity
wow qt is such a good guy <3 w
hile most people

are spending new years with their friends and family, t
his legend is feeding the hungry on the rift. much love brother and happy new year.
My $0.99 starter bundle put me well above the other players. But, when I reached the first enemy castle. I couldn't beat it. I checked the in game shop. "BONUS SILVER TROOPS $4.99 EXPIRES IN 3:14:28" I happily spent $4.99. Shortly after I came across an elite boss I couldnt beat. So I checked the in game shop. "BONUS GOLD TROOPS. 5000 RESOURCES. $19.99 EXPIRES IN 1:05:39" It's about to expire! I quickly entered my credit card and bought the bundle, it was such a steal. I love Art of Conquest!
Wow guys, enabling bttv gif emotes was by far the worst decision of my life. Is spamming chat with these annoying  emotes really the only t

"Give me a second, guys," Kripp says. "Gotta
hit up the bathroom" He turns
down the volume on
his microphone, and immediately gives Dex a swift kick
down the stairs. As Dex yelps loudly in pain, Kripp overturns the ne

arest chair, yelling "Fuck t
his game!" as loudly as he can. Rania tries to calm
him
down, but Kripp swiftly bodyslams her onto a glass coffee table. After taking a few deep breaths, Kripp wipes the blood off of
his face, sits back
down at
his computer, and resumes
his stream.
As Jeff Kaplan st

ares at me through my computer screen, I begin to contemplate reality. What truly has substance in t
his realm of technology, avarice and sin? What is our future, if not a blank, hollow not
hing, rife with silence and strife?
Why
do so many people watch t
his washed up player? He is so bad at t
his game. Why is
his hair so long? Does hair length have a connection to a players skill? Is that why girls

are so bad at league?
You know what's worse than Ajit Pai? To access the punchline to t
his joke,


you must purchase the Punchline Package for $14.99
You must pay for the Social Media Package with


your internet service provider to view t
his post. Package includes, but is not limited to: Facebook, Twitter, Myspace, Reddit, Tumblr, and more. Offers start at $3.99 per month per household. Minimum one-year contract. Exclusions may apply. $15.99 activation fee per device. See site for details.

you guys

are distracting me. If

you would stop the spamming and copying and pasting. God, I

My favorite streamer is the Kripparrian. I often find my self watc

The year is 2088, Kripp lays tattered on
his deathbed,
his organs absolutely ravaged from years of veganism. He turns to
his computer monitor for one last look at
his beloved twitch chat only to see a bunch of weebs, emote spam and copy pasta. Tears fill
his lifeless, vegan eyes. Rania is at
his side as he draws on all

Today my 12 year old son and I walked into harvard to sign
him up for college. The dean rudly asked what a 12 year old was
doing signing up for such a prestigious institute like harvard. My son took of to reveal
his Rick and Morty s
hirt and proclaimed "Well


you see sir I watch Rick and Morty". A look of confusion came over the deans face and I have never been so proud. The dean quickly made sure to appologize to my son but it was too late, the police rushed in and dragged
him out. My son passed all
his classes with 4.0s and graduated top of
his class in the first day of college.
When I was in school I used to have an IQ of 15. My classmates used to harass me for not being that smart. But since 2013, my life has changed. My IQ is now 195 and it increases by 5 every time I sit
down on Saturday nights to watch t
his one show. It is called Rick and Morty. Because of that, I get all the girls and people

are always comparing me to Albert Einstein, some even say that I am the cure for cancer. When the government found out that I watch Rick and Morty, they showed up to my residence and took me to a secret facility to take an exam. The exam was about explaining all the jokes in Rick and Morty and I had to answer each question in all currently spoken languages. Since I watched Rick and Morty, I didn't have any problems and I completed it in 30 minutes. The next day, I got to see the results and I passed the exam with a score of 100%. They gave me the title "Smartest Man in Existence". Guess I am out of t
his world.
You see, I have a very
high IQ. Do


you want to know why? Well, I'll tell


you anyways, I have a
high IQ because I watch t
his amazing television show (w
hich to my surprise piqued my interest unlike many other television shows) Rick and Morty. T
his show is remarkably intellectual (Like me, mind


you) and not like any other animated shows. My most favorite joke from the show is "WUBALUBADUBDUB" it makes me giddy inside and knowing the common folk wont understand the joke makes me laugh even harder!
Hi I'm 13 and I just started watc
hing Rick and Morty and I can tell


you for a fact it's my favorite show!!. Lik the one time Ricky said said there's probably like no good !!!! i was agreeing so much I'am smarter then


you're average fidget spinner teen at middle school to even though I have one. I may be


young but I'm smarter then every theist on earth basically the show is also really deep when they said like no one was born for a reason I was so blown away as they must have big balls to say that on tv so I told my friends on minecraft and they agree too. LOL once when my mom took me to McDonald's I asked for the Mulan dipping sauce and the dumb bitch didn't even get the reference XD One time in class i evan shouted "I'm PICKLE RIIIICK!" and Mrs.Janice told me to go outside i fucking hate that cunt school is for dumb ppl just like what Rick said, i m too smart for such imbicells. But yeah I love Rick and Morty and I'm actually smart enough to get it to.
I pretended to be a girl in csgo competitive matchmaking. At first we just played csgo together, but we worked up to more. I even skyped dressed as a sexy woman "with poor connection" so the video would blur. After many seductive photos of my ass in my sisters underwear I convinced
him I was the real deal. It took me 3 weeks to become
his girlfriend. Eventually I scammed t
his guy out of $600 because I convinced
him I would come visit if he paid for the flight. I was lucky it paid off because i had spent nearly $200 on make up to pull off t
his con. He also gifted me over 20 games on steam. 11/10 would
do again. It was actually a nice weekend when I flew to visit
him and didn't even mind sucking cock. We're looking to move in together in October.
Teenagers and man c
hildren according to who? You? What is


your standard? I'm a fan of Rick and Morty, and I've been watc
hing since episode one. Most of my friends who

are scientists love the show, because it has a sense of humor and plot lines that


you need a STEM mind simply to follow, let alone interpret and appreciate. Most of the people who diss the show

are standard literature, p
hilosophy, sociology a business majors who would rather watch s
hit like The Office or How I Met Your Mother and other s

Just shut the fuck up. T
his copypasta was never even funny to begin with. I've never even seen the show, and it was obviously a joke. What kind of idiot
do


you have to be to t

hing w
hich is popular, and therefore popular to s
hit on among the contrarians on Reddit. Come on, really. I actually
do have to wonder about the IQs of people who like that pretentious copypasta. You know, I sometimes can't help but superiorly smirk as I imagine their dumb faces struggling to understand words on a mere internet webpage. In fact, I sometimes find myself in paroxysms of ironic Schadenfreude as I envision the visages of the aforementioned Slow-in-the-minds waging war with the Cultural Artifact they proclaim to be analyzing, only to fall, slack-jawed, back into their insensate stupor, the proverbial Undiscovered Country, "from whose bourn no traveler returns" .
My teacher said to my I'm a failure, that I'll never amount to anyt

him. Shocked, my teacher asked what's so funny, my future is on the line. "Well...


you see professor" I say as the teacher prep

ares to laugh at my answer, rebuttal at hand. "I watch Rick and Morty." The class is shocked, they merely watch pleb shows like the big bang theory to feign intelligence, not grasping the humor. "...how? I can't even understand it's sheer nuance and subtlety." "Well


you see...WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB!" One line student laughs in the back, I turn to see a who t
his fellow genius is. It's none other than Albert Einstein.

I hate that guy's emotes so much. They all look like some 6 year old made them in MS Paint, and I'm not talking about the purposefully bad ones. And all they

are ones that
do t

do with the defaults. And the insufferable people who use those emotes find any reason to use any of them, even if they're not related, because they're that proud of a 4.99 purchase. I'd rather sub to a guy I liked watc

My son is running around the house without pants saying "Who Came". I came over to

At t

his gets copied I will leave.
"kappa t

you sell it as one, zoo is not a control deck. At least not a conventional one.
Saronite Chain Gang is quickly becoming one of my least favorite cards. It's just so hopeless and suffering. It comes on the board like "How long can t

I am honestly so sick and tired of people objectifying Kripp. Like yeah I get it he's a hyper-attractive vegan with large muscles and a beautiful aesthetic but that's not the point of the stream. I remember the good old days when he played PoE and everyone was just here for the memes and the gameplay but t
hings have changed. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate the healthy lifestyle Kripp has a
dopted and I find it hard to look away from the camera but it just feels wrong. Maybe I'm just jealous

The mitochondrion (plural mitochondria) is a
double membrane-bound organelle found in all eukaryotic organisms. Some cells in some multicellular organisms may however lack them (for example, mature mammalian red blood cells). A number of unicellular organisms, such as microsporidia, parabasalids, and diplomonads, have also reduced or transformed their mitochondria into other structures. To date, only one eukaryote, Monocercomonoides, is known to have completely lost its mitochondria.

you a "pro gamer." Have a nice day and good luck to


your future endeavors.

"SAVE THE INTERNET" refers to the imminent removal of net neutrality, w

It also restricts them from unfairly throttling speeds and access to specific websites. If net neutrality is abolished, Twitch will be inaccessible to most Americans.

Is there any particular reason that


your subs

are the most toxic, useless wastes of life on all of twitch? I get that streaming gaming tends to attract a lot of losers, but what is it about


your subs that makes them so uniquely cancerous? What makes them want to venture out of their trailers and basements to spam and s
hitpost where they

aren't wanted? Is it too much to ask that


you savages contain


yourselves to the bowels of twitch?

Kripp tenderly slid back the wrapper of the card pack. His fingers were soft and smelled faintly of cucumber. He slowly pulled out the card, c

My daughter was born with a hearing impairment than ultimately left her deaf shortly after birth. I have been working for years to pay for a new surgery that would allow her to hear again. Today was her 8th birthday and I managed to get her what she's always wanted for her birthday, the sense of hearing. I decided to let her listen in on what Daddy has been watc
hing late at night and I turn on


your stream and what
do I hear? Silence. Now she's crying t
hinking she's deaf again, Nice job Kripp.
Kripp has NEVER said "I LOVE YOU" to chat. We've been with

doesn't say "I love

We

are gathered here today in memorium of the Overwatch professional player xGodSlayerx. In life, he demanded healing and better teammates who were not bitch idiot noob feeders. In death, he is an icon of Genji players everywhere. His legacy of epic zero-kill dragonblades and Blizzcon-worthy shuriken throwing skills have inspired a generation of one-trick DPS players in Masters and below. Perhaps what he needed was not heal bitch, or s
hield bitch, but a feel bitch.

I want Zarya's giant feet to squash my face and suffocate me and gives me no mercy, I want her to squash my head with her gigantic t

Imo moonmoon's chat is the worst. It's an endless stream of purple lady faces and various other meaningless emotes. S
hit isn't even funny. I legit stopped watc
hing moonmoon because I can't handle
his chat. I know twitch chat is fairly toxic in general but at least people actually use words to communicate in other chats. Moonmoon's minions

are so immersed in their 3 s
hitty memes that they themselves have become a meme.
The game of "s
hitpost" is a gentlemans' sport played by
high society clubs like S.M.E.G. on emoting grounds across twitch. To play, one player posts a satirical block of text to the pitch, usually with a paygated emote such as moon2SMEG . Next, the other players copy and paste the same message w
hile simultaneously laug
hing at the misfortune of the lower class.
Metal isn't so great? Are


you kidding me? metal requires more talent than any other genre of music. And moonmoon_ow hates it? Thats ridiculous, metal is the best unlike stupid normie music. Moonmoon_ow shouldn't

I hate Moonmoon_ow's chat so much. All they
do is spam a stupid copy pasta or some other moronic emote and circlejerk with each other. Why can't they
do somet

I thought fidget spinning was a dumb trend, but then I got mine. I felt the spin, I felt it on my finger, I felt the rush of a good spin. It changed me. I got my spinner ironically, but I was wrong.

Leeroy Jenkins created a strategy that revolved around trying to defeat


your opponent in one turn without requiring any cards on the board. Fighting for board control and battles between minions make an overall game of Hearthstone more fun and compelling, but taking 20+ damage in one turn is not particularly fun or interactive.

I despise with a burning acidic passion any streamer that isn't MOONMOON. Every night I print out an 8.5 x 11" picture of a streamer that is not MOONMOON and wipe my ass with it.Honestly, anyone who watches any streamer except forMOONMOON deserves to be tarred, and feathered, then burned at the stake. That's how fucking much I HATE stramers. (Besides MOONMOON, of course).

Is there even a vegan saltier than Kripp? And I'm referring to when Kripp gets Deathwinged in Arena (topdeck) on a 0-2 run after
his Mad Bomber missed lethal against a 1 Health Mage with an empty board, who had just used a Sha

his Bog Creeper, but not before the opponent used Flamestrike on
his board of buffed Doppelgangsters, and then one more time after he just played Onyxia (who then got Ice Lanced and then Shattered).
So I says to my friend, I says, "Where can I go to find some

dorable little 1/1 can ping t

I miss the old Voyboy, SoloQ troll Voyboy. Not playing tanks Voyboy, teamfight flanks Voyboy. I hate the new Voyboy, the never rude Voyboy, family friendly streams Voyboy, the too polite Voyboy, meta slave Voyboy, t

I miss the old Harambe. Straight from the zoo Harambe. Eating

I gotta say at that time I'd like to meet Harambe. See I invented Harambe. It wasnt any Harambes. And now i look and look around and there's no more Harambes.
There was a heated discussion among the medical experts gathered around an operating table, on w
hich laid an unconscious Romanian man in
his 30s. "The salt levels

are off the charts!" exclaimed a cardiologist. The head surgeon sighs, "I guess t
his is what


you get when


you combine a vegan
diet and a sedentary lifestyle playing a c
hildren's card game." Upon those words the body suddenly stirs, from w
hich a muted voice b

arely croaks, "Tell...Rania...not to press...the button".
 what if we all send the same message?
Kripp will never, ever click the button. The expansions will release at a faster rate than he can collect dust. Much like the contents of the briefcase in Pulp Fiction, the button is merely a carrot Kripp dangles in front of
his viewers without any intention of actually delivering. T
his is blatantly obvious - he even admits he
doesn't bother to calculate because he knows he'll never click it. We will spam t
his pasta until the button has been clicked.

Ben Brode twirls
his fingers in Anduins soft dirty blond hair. "If I
do t
his, will


you make me great again?" Anduin asks as he starts to undress. "Just
do as I say and I'll give


you the next Dr. Boom". Anduin nods as Ben Brode slams
his Temple Enforcer into Anduins 0/5 lightwell. After Boom-botting for 3 seconds, "HAAHAAHAA! YOU HAVE BEEN PURIFIED!" Brode yells as he SCAMAZes all over Anduins face.
First, some perspective. I'm a PURIFY-PRIEST player. If


you
don't know what that is, it's not important, just know it's a deck I'm very passionate about and that I've played for three years now. That's right, I've played the same deck for the years, and it's never gotten stale. Why? Because the enjoyment comes from mastering the deck, from fine tuning my decision making, my sequencing, from learning how to play around the latest and greatest shenanigans.
Purify created a strategy that revolved around trying to lose to


your opponent in one turn without requiring any cards on the board. Silencing


your own minions and battles between the players and Blizzard make an overall game of Hearthstone more fun and compelling, but spending 2 mana on a trash card in one turn is not particularly fun or interactive.
The year is 2017 - Rania is playing hardstone w
hile her puerto rican lover performs felatio on her. She queues into an UNKNOWN and instantly receives a message from the Kripp. "T
his is so unfair! It`s not my fault vegans can`t eat p*#sy! You have 30 minutes to come back home before I shoot myself and dex in the face with my vegan gun!" She aggressively slams the desk: "DAMN IT!". "Que se pasa amor" Antonio looks up perplexed, She replies: "Turn 1 go first zombie chow...".
I sexually Identify as Harambe. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of living in a gorilla enclosure at Cincinnati zoo and dragging c

I sexually identify as a priest player. Everyday I dream about flying into ranked games and conceding to rank 25 players. Call me retarded. I

you're a holy-phobe and need to check


your concede privileges. Thank


you for being so understanding.
Hey guys blizzard here and we just wanted to say purify is a great card if


you combo it with ancient watcher


you spend 2 cards to get a 4 mana 4/5! t

Local police

are baffled by a string of strange popsicle burglaries that have taken place over the past few days. The t

Police have yet to apprehend the burglar, but have several reports of a suspicious lanky figure with poor hygiene seen near the crime scenes muttering about "value." Any further information on the popsicle bandit should be reported immediately.

"How did Kripp get 12 wins?" Ben Brode demanded at the board meeting. "You were supposed to be monitoring
him, Charlie." "Sorry, I must've fallen asleep. He was streaming some boring action-RPG earlier today." Ben Brode frowned. "The salt shortage is cutting into our profits. We're going to need a solution, quick." Sarah raised her hand. "What if we make Firelands Portal a common?"

Ben Brode here! We

are happy to announce we have finally solved an issue that has plagued Hearthstone since beta. Despite our best efforts with cards like Flamecannon and Ethereal Conjurer, Mage was still able to lose games in Arena. With the Old Gods we introduced Faceless Summoner, and yet mage's average

arena winrate was still only 75%. With the introduction of Firelands Portal, we hope to finally make Mage a viable

arena class.

 Howdy Kripp, my name is Bill and I work in the meat industry. I'm getting pretty sick and tired of all the vegan propaganda

"I won't

dow, and Kripp is shocked to see it is none other than Scamaz. "I give the order, and Rania and Pupparian

POLICE REPORT - Canadian Mounties have at last apprehended the "Romanian Salt Baron" after suspiciously salty w
hining was heard outside of a dingy apartment in Toronto. The Salt Baron, a morose, balding gypsy man, was at the time playing a c
hildren's card game when Mounties burst through the
door. The man attempted to resist by "brofisting" the officials, but
his scrawny vegan arms had no effect. The man's wife then assumed her true Succubus form and escaped into the Nether. More at 11.

BREAKING NEWS - Canadian scientists have discovered what they

Hey Kripp, how's it going, Faeria Dev here. We noticed that

are interesting and entertaining. To fix t

Faeria created a strategy that revolved around sponsoring popular streamers without requiring any enjoyable gameplay. Trying to promote new and innovative games makes an overall stream more fun and compelling, but not bothering to explain the game and leaving the chat confused during the entire stream is not particularly fun or interactive.

By complaining about copypastas


you

are just making it worse. Can't


you see that? Every time


you comment and complain about people posting the same comments each time just adds to the incentive for people who t

are funny to continue. I am willing to bet that t
his comment will turn into a *** copypasta at t
his point just because of how "funny" and "ironic" it would be to make a copypasta out of a comment complaining about copypastas.

Reynad was getting ready for
his first HTC cast. His palms were sweaty. Frodan sits next to

his eyes.

There is a bunch of Twitch overlords who grow batches of streamers from genetically modified eggs. When these eggs hatch and grow, they

are given their first computer and start streaming a Dora the Explorer game. As they grow up, the most popular streamers advance and

are given more complex games to stream, from CoD to Hearthstone. Each streamer lives in a small cubicle, and there

are hundreds upon hundreds of cubicles on the grounds of the Twitch Headquarters.
Here in my garage with my pasta linguini, but

Reynad layed in
his bed. Somet
hing just wasnt right. He felt cold and uncomfortable. He needed somet
hing, but what? He went out to the kitchen to see if he could find somet
hing to
do the trick. On the top shelf he found it. He laid back in bed and poured the spaghetti sauce all over
his noodle body to keep warm for the night. Reynad became
his final form, the Reynoodle.

After Reynad began using only pictures of
his forehead for
his Tinder account,
his amount of female attention increased drastically. One woman was particularly ready to hop in bed with
him. "I'm going to make so much money off of t
his t
hirsty Ukrainian!" she said to herself. Unfortunately for her she left her phone on with Andrey's Tinder profile open and
his forehead heard her. She "disappe

 Andrey Yanuk otherwise known as Reynad has passed away t
his Saturday's afternoon. He was ambushed by a group of

"Well," Kripp drawled, a toothy grin splitting
his face, "I t
hink chess is a little too basic a game for me. I mean, only 6 different types of pieces? It's a game for c
hildren. No strategy whatsoever" That said, he proceeded to chortle as
his opponents Huffer triggered
his effigy, creating a Nexus Champion Sarad. "Outplayed."

The average length of Kripp's stream has decreased over the past 3 years from an average length of 11 hours to the current average of 5 hours. In 2 more years, Kripp will stream for 0 hours. What's the cause? Sources say Kripp has contracted a terminal illness - Casualitis. Soon he will join Katarrian in Heaven.

As I approached the Kripp with my bulging juiced up biceps, I heard a snicker. "Soda is healt

him I can already tell the only t

him, he top decks Big Game Hunter and I am shot dead. "Who's juiced now?" smirks the Kripp.
You have just become intrigued as to what t

Reynad wakes up after the final night of Blizzcon. "Never lucky", he says. "I wouldn't say that", says a voice to
his side. Reynad rolls over and to
his surprise, it's a hot grill. "Wow! How did I manage t
his?", he asks. "You

are very persuasive", purrs the grill. "What's


your name?" Reynad asks. "Chat calls me Scamaz", Scamaz laughs as he pulls off
his wig.
Reynad ran crying out of the house. Knowing somet
hing was wrong, Frodan ran out after
him. "What's wrong?" Frodan asked Reynad. Reynad replied with tears in
his eyes, "Everyone was making fun of me." "Why?" Frodan said. Reynad b

arely eked out the words, "I can use promo code TEMPO to get 3% off of everyt
hing, except my forehead."
A long long time ago, when Kripp was noLife, he stumbled across an old woman in an alleyway after buying some lentil soup. She told Kripp to give
him the soup and in return he would find a beautiful girl. Unfortunately, Kripp didnt realize the old woman was the succubus Raina, who would eventually make
him a simple casualarrians

Sometimes when I see my opponent drop that Warsong Commander, I quickly turn my volume up to max, let go of my mouse, lean back in my chair and close my eyes. I let the sounds of w

Twitch Chat created a strategy that revolved around trying to defeat

I remember a time when copypasta was biting satire and prophetic indictments of contemporary Twitch chat. Copypasta when I was a


younger teenager had the potency to topple Nazi moderators
hips and revolutionize new chat epochs. Even the truncation of "copypasta" to "pasta" shows a lack of eloquence that speaks volumes. If, like me,


you

are a product of those better times and wish to see them return then speak out. Let the memers and Toucans know that real copypasta back.
Dear Kripp, I own the apple orchard outside Toronto and I am begging

It is the year 2016, the Paparrian waits patiently outside Kripp's Sellout Castle. The butler, Trump, opens the
door and bows, "His Grace will see

Trump wakes up with a scream and hugs

Can we all stop hating on Amaz for a moment? I mean, yes, he is a colossal fake cunt, moneysucking parasite, and selfish prick. But he is one of the few representations of the gay community in Hearthstone.

your opponent on 1 health and ending turn is NOT missed lethal. Not using Grommash on explosive trap for lethal is NOT missed lethal. It is pure outplay and master-level BM. So, next time


you spam 'MISSED LEGAL' in chat like retards, t
hink again. Watch and learn kids,
do as the masters.
Nice job kripp! You won at a card game that requires an intense amount of skill. I pray that my sons will be like


you and win card games with the amount of skill that


you win with! If not I'll sacrifice them to RNGesus and pray that they

are decent and competent enough to be as incredible as


you!
Stop it guys, Kripp

his hand, only
his opponents draw from the top of their decks
Wow,


you imbeciles

yourselves like parrots, spouting puerile taunts at each other, using crude 'emoticons'... Can

you'll all be too dumb to even type

Kripp, Google again here. We've noticed that

I stayed up all night, dreaming of t

are strewn across the filthy bedroom floor. "Oh look it's another sub," says the Kripp. I am now fully erect. "Welcome to the five
dollar club, bro" I b

arely hear as a single tear runs
down my cheek w
hile Kripp's fist fills me completely with value.
When Kripp gets topdecked, it's seen as a bit of salty fun. BUT when Reynad gets a 420 YOLO Rag Pro 5000
hit to the face with 6 different minions on the board, lethal next turn, together with top-deck skill command with one mana webspinner, he's called Salt God?
As he raises
his "Bro Fist" gently against

The year is 1945. "Hafu," Trump speaks breathlessly into the night. "Get back to the time mac
hine. We have what we need here." A foul smirk plays upon
his lips as he pockets a top-secret Nazi folder marked "Sub Mode." Lightning flashes and thunder crashes far across the German mountains. "We will see who says Tuck Frump' now," he says.

On November 10th, 2014, Octavian "Kripparian" Morosan was found to be severely delusional. He began wandering around
his home, mumbling 'brofist' and 'subscribe'. As
his weak fist was placed gently on the webcam, a single tear ran
down
his cheek. He knew he was a sellout.
My name is Octavius Kripparius Muridius, commander of the PJSalteers of the North, General of the Salty Legions and loyal servant to the TRUE emperor, Saltarrian. Father to a Flamestriked son, husband to a Top decked wife. And I will have my vengeance, in t

Trump got kicked out of Blizzcon when security asked

That's an extremely unfortunate loss Kripp, even though


you outplayed
him on every possible level he still beat


you, i've never seen anyone as unlucky as


you that match, nor anyone as lucky as he was that match. It shouldn't even be legal for someone as bad as

T
his chat is the dumbest group of people i've ever seen. I work with mentally handicapped people and i've been all over the world. I have been to beauty pageants and monster truck events. I have met a kid with an IQ of 8. I have even met President George W. Bush. But t
his chat is truly the most retarded t

Hi Kripp,
do

Hello Kripparian, Leon Tidewellow here, CEO of PETA. My sources tell me that


you haven't pet


your cat in over 3 years, and thats a little too long. I'll give

Who c

ares! It is a scientific fact that the human eye cannot tell the difference. In fact i'd argue that 60 fps looks worse. 60 fps is too smooth, it's like petting a shark, the scales (frames)

are too smooth so it cuts


your hand (eyes), w
hile 30 fps is nice and stable and gives


you a better immersion because the frames travel a longer distance so the world looks bigger
Paparrian was born in Germany, the


youngest of the five c
hildren (three of whom survived) of Hanz Hector Paparrian, from a noble family of the province of Freiberg. In 1932, he began
his medical c

areer in Theo
dor Meynert's psyc
hiatric clinic at the Trollstein General Hospital. The same year, he married Mamarrian, the granddaughter of Isaac Bernays, a c
hief rabbi in Hamburg. In the summer of 1935, the couple had a beautiful and gifted c
hild: Kripp. On 15 September 1935, Hitler presented two laws who deprived so-called "non-Aryans" of the benefits of German citizens
hip. The


young p

arents, extremely afraid for the future of their beautiful c
hild, where confronted to a question that would forever change the fate of the world: was Krip Aryan?
When Cybrix buys a Pepperoni pizza, its seen as a bit of greasy fun. BUT when Kripp orders a 420 GreaseMaster Pro 5000 garbage pizza pie with 6 different types of pepperoni, spiceified sauce with non-drip collection tray, together with optional built in Cheese crust, hes called Fattarrian
How the ever loving *** is t

Dear Mr Morosan, I was unaw

are of the fact that upon subscribing to

his horrible attack on my privacy has caused.
Did You Know? YAYO was first found in America in the year 1070. The native Dongers sang it to

People say Hitler is finally gone right? Well guess what, he isn't.  revived

Dear Kripp, t

Wait a minute. I just spotted an inconsistency. Could t
his be the work of the CIA? Look closely... below the stream. "10,000 viewers". What the heck? There's only 7 million people in the world, how could there possibly be 10 million viewers right now?
Dear Kripp, t

you brutally brofisted a small defenseless Kitten in its a

Remember boys and girls, its not good to copy pasta. It makes

So I went to a Strip Club in Greece the other night and guess who i saw there. It was the Kripp with hundreds of 5
dollar bills. So the Stripper goes in a hot pose, Kripp smiles and pours
himself a glass of OJ. Kripp said "Welcome to the 5 Dollar Club" and they went into a private room. Not sure what .happened then but i guess he gave her a brofist.
Last night in Greece, Greek police heard reports of a Canadian man in a blue tacky sweater walking around the streets at night, 'brofisting' the local population. As a result 20,000 greek citizens have contracted the casualitis. If


you see t
his man,
please report to greek policerino department.

Hi guys Kripp here with VEGAN FACTS! Did


you know that milk is literally !Worse Than Hitler! and also killed many people during the Twitch Chat-ocaust in the 1940's? If


you drink milk


your bones will be as frail as Reynad's Rag RNG and


you'll basically be Leifman's brother. Well, that's all for today's vegan facts! Bye guys! BRO FIST!!
My dad drank milk
his whole life. One day my mom told
him "If u want to see ur c
hildren graduate, u have to stop" 3 years later he
died of calcium deficiency. My mom told me "Dont drink milk;
dont put


your family through t
his" At 24, I have never touched a glass of milk. I must say, I feel a sense of regret, because watc
hing Kripp play Hearthstone gave me calcium deficiency anyway.
The teacher asked Kripp, "Why is


your cat at school today Kripp?" Kripp replied crying, "Because I heard my daddy tell my mommy, 'I am going to eat that p*ssy once Kripp leaves for school today!'

Kripp, how can

arently I was mistaken. For the sake of ***. Unsubbed, unfollowed and unremembered. Bye, Kripp.

As I sit here in the land of free

I want to touch the kripp, I tell myself. I save up my salt for years to get a trip to greece. I ring the

do have fireball" from that day foward Ive never washed my face again.
I owe my life to Cybrix. I got in a horrible car crash and i was in 6 month coma. The nurse switched to the Twitch channel to Kripp's stream. I awoke from my coma and muted Cybrix.
Romanian
doctor say in t

You guys

Hello guys, I'm back from my 200 seconds timeout. During that time I was able to finish my 200 words essay on the topic of Nazi Germany. My thesis is that Hitler & Nazi beliefs

Sometimes, whenever i eat M&Ms, i like to hold two m&ms in between my fingers and squeeze as hard as i can until one m&m cracks. I eat the cracked one and the one that didn't crack becomes champion, then i grab another m&m and force it to compete with the champion in t
his deadly game of m&m gladiators. I
do t
his until i run out of m&ms, and when there is one left standing i send a letter to m&ms brand with the champion in it and a note attached that reads "
please use t
his m&m for breeding purposes"
Every game is equally pointless. You can't put t

Once upon a time, I opened a LoL game. I entered the game, and I was promptly greeted by another player. I noticed it was a female player and I was pleasantly surprised.

Maybe
his long Journey away from the evil drug that is Hearthstone has brought moral clarity to
his life. Kripp rises up and breaks away from the shackles the succubus has locked Kripp in. Papaparrian holds the key and sets Kripp's mind free. He
swears to never go back to Greece or play Hearthstone ever again. Kripp moves back in with Papa and finally gets
his OJ sponsors
hip. The beautifully creamy wall is vibrant as Kripp uploads
his newest video in the old wonderland. "Hey guys how's it going, Kripparian here." Kripp starts up PoE again in anticipation of the new expansion being released, theory crafting builds. He is happy and filled with life each day of streaming.

All is then right with the world.

I
don't get why Kripp has to have the personality of an unflushed toilet when he streams. At least when he's in mumble we can love to hate Cybrix. And a mumblebro or two spices t

The Kripp goes to grocery store. He sees the OJ and yells : Well met ! An old lady next to

Kripp, I'm disappointed in


you. Your chat is out of control and


you
don't even c

are the most pathetic scum on Twitch. Even worse, Hafu is a more hardcore player than


you. Are


you even trying anymore? Whatever, I'm going to go watch Reynad or Trump,


you useless bag of ***.

Omg Kripp... I remember seeing

you. ~Eddy Pepperino (not wearing any panties atm).
You guys

are ruining my twitch chat experience. I come to the twitch chat for mature conversation about the gameplay, only to be awarded with kappa faces and frankerzs. People who spam said faces need medical attention utmost. The twitch chat is serious business, and the mods should really raise their
dongers.
"Kripp my son," say the Papparin, "


you

are such a large pepperoni, why

aren't


you a pizza." But the Kripp
don't respond. He elopes to Greece and runs
his hand through
his unshaven face scruff and say "Well met!" to the twisted Succubus. Alone in
his heart, Papparin commits su
doku at a Starbucks in San Bernardino with Al Pacino, no cappucino.
In greece, Kripparrian has risening from

Reynad is like a pigeon. Pigeons

Krippler's aim is to establish a New Order of absolute Nazi German hegemony in the Twitch Metaverse. To t

so i was walking
down the road today and 2 black hoodlums approached me. They asked "dawg u a crip or a blood fool". Startled, i muttered "I'm a kripp". The power of morosan rushed through my body, i raised my

How exactly
does one get pussy w
hile living at the w
hite house as a teenage boy? The secret service always cock blocking


you. when


you're trying to run game on some foreign prime ministers daughter the news media catches


you smiling at her and immediately blows s
hit out if proportion speculating that


you

are somehow breaking international law with


your awkward teenage flirting, so


you have to testify before congress that


you didn't give away any top secret
documents to her and

are made to admit live on C-SPAN that


you've never even kissed a girl . Then


you get blue balls from some hot conservative girl winking at


you and flas
hing her panties under her skirt and making sexy faces and blow job motions to


you w
hile


you were going through some airport or public event, and when


you passed by and shook her hand she leans in w
hispering she is going to diddle her clit t
hinking about


you tonight and how much she wants to suck


your dick off, just to fuck with


you. Then


you try to look up some porn when


you get home just to relieve the tension but


you just know the CIA is monitoring and 3 other govornment agencies

are watc
hing


you beat off. Then


you finally break
down and Jack off in the shower w
hich sets off some fucking biohazard drain alarm and the entire place is on lock
down until they can find the source of the specimen and


you end up getting debriefed by the joint c
hiefs of staff about


your masturbatory habits and how


you almost created a national security issue with


your dick. Then wikileaks leaks


your search
history showing


you looked up penis enlargement techniques when it was actually just some click bait


you'd accidentally clicked and TYT spends all next week talking about


your supposed micro penis. So


you end up squirming a little since


you

are so wound up and being judged constantly and now people

are saying


you look like a fucking mental patient and


you start to t

you'll never get any pussy.

Many people always ask me how I was able to get into Harvard as a 16 year old who skipped 3 grades of

high school as valedictorian at the age of 14. I then worked as an intern at both Telsa, and NASA." Suddenly the room burst into laughter and many of board instantly started scribbling
down "No" near the application check marks. The Dean says "Sorry but


you

are just not the type we

are looking for." But then I said "Excuse me but I wasn't finished... I watch Rick and Morty" The Dean looked at me like an idiot and said "So....?" Then I replied with a smile "And I understand all the references and subtle jokes" An audible gasp let out by the board was so loud the secretary had to come in. You could hear a pin drop and then suddenly all at once the entire board clicked their pens on the "Approved Box" and I was instantly handed a diploma and now I'm teac
hing advanced physicals there. I guess


you can say I'm pretty smart. :)

My teacher said to my I'm a failure, that I'll never amount to anyt
hing.
I scoffed at
him.
Shocked, my teacher asked what's so funny, my future is on the line.
"Well...


you see professor" I say as the teacher prep

ares to laugh at my answer, rebuttal at hand.
"I watch Rick and Morty."
The class is shocked, they merely watch pleb shows like the big bang theory to feign intelligence, not grasping the humor.
"...how? I can't even understand it's sheer nuance and subtlety."
"Well


you see...WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB!"
One line student laughs in the back, I turn to see a who t
his fellow genius is.
It's none other than Albert Einstein.

The t
hing I really like about Planes is that we learn that WWII happened in the Cars universe. W
hich means there was a Cars Hitler, a Cars holocaust, a Cars Pacific War, a Cars D-Day, a Cars nuking of Hiros
hima and Nagasaki, a Cars Rape of Nanking, a Cars Battle of Iwo Jima...
T
his leads to so many important questions, like: were the Cars Little Boy and Fat Man nukes sentient? Was it a suicide mission? Are ALL Cars nuclear weapons sentient? Did Tsar Bomba have a personality?
What kind of car was Car Hitler? A VW? A forklift?
Was there a Cars 9/11? Were the planes
hijacked, or were the planes themselves radicalized?
I could go on
Edit: I just realized a Cars 9/11 gives a whole new layer of meaning to the phrase "let's roll"

EDIT: Turns out t
his is the realest source.

I'm convinced that mattress/furniture stores exist in a quantum superposition of grand opening and going out of business sale.
It is both and neither at once until an observer records the state at w
hich point it becomes one or the other.
But because


you know exactly where the store is located,


you cannot know how fast it is going out of business because of


your uncertainty about its business momentum.
All around us, all the time pairs of anti-discount mattress stores and discount mattress stores

are popping into existence, forming the quantum memory foam that is the basis for the universe.  Without the pressure of t
his quantum memory foam strip malls would collapse.
We can see evidence of t
his when a pair is created such that one half is wit
hin the sales radius of a supermassive furniture store like Ikea-- one of them is pulled in and the other escapes as a Hawking mattress store.

Ok, t
his has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know


you're going to roll


your eyes, but hear me out: Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.
Here's why:
T
hink about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.
Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when


you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to


your eyes. You

aren't looking at it--


you're looking at a picture of it.
Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breec
hing charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.
And have


you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanw
hile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.
Now I know what


you're going to say: "But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they
do many times throughout the books/movies). But w
hich is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?
Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.
Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing
his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratc
hing a lightning bolt into
his rifle stock for each kill. I
don't t
hink Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape


your brains off of the trees and put


you back together after somet
hing like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave
his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope


you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.
I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick
his cig

arette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:
"Well then I guess it's a good t
hing my 1911 holds 7+1."
And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.

I'm Harambe, and t
his is my zoo enclosure. I work here with my zoo keeper and my friend, cecil the lion. Everyt
hing in here has a story and a price. One t
hing I've learned after 21 years -


you never know WHO is gonna come over that fence.

"Niggerfaggot" is ok to say because a negative times a negative is a positive. It's just basic math dude. Go back to 7th grade if


you
don't understand it but I'm going to keep bringing positivity and tolerance to the world with t
his word.

Hey, Vsauce, Michael here! Down here. But w
hich way is
down? And how much
does
down weigh? Well,
down weighs about 1/100 of a g/cm3 .  It is light, and airy, w
hich makes it a great source of insulation and buoyancy for waterbirds.  But if


you let go of
down, it falls
down. So that's w
hich way
down is, it's the direction that gravity is pulling everyt
hing. Now for someone on the other side of the Earth, my
down is their up, but where

are falling t
hings going? Why
do t
hings fall? Are they being pushed or pulled? Or, is it because of TIME  TRAVEL.

If I had a
dollar for every gender, I'd only have 2 bucks and millions of illegal counterfeit
dollar bills that only bring sadness and disappointment in the human race and

are a scar on the face of earth, ruining and vandalising every-fucking-t

Hey guys I'm not gay, I play football. I accidentally clicked t
his thread because I thought my mouse was hovered over the hot girls thread. Well, since I'm here I had a question let's say hypothetically I had gay thoughts (lol yea right) and I found my close friend attractive (ew gross) and one day we had sex in the back of my car after football practice (I would puke...the only t
hing I bang is c
hicks with big tits


you know what I'm saying lol) but we didn't kiss. Would that be gay? We were wasted and w
hile we were banging we kept calling each other fags. It's almost like a parody of when we bang c
hicks (remember t
his didn't happen). So that wouldn't make me gay right? Just a jokester?

You know what? I'll have


you know that when I'm at max strength, I can break a bone in


your body with ONE PUNCH. Seriously, ask my brother.

All right, so if instead of an "additionally calculated" Destroy Dick December (w
hich means 1 nuts
+ 2 nuts
+ 3 nuts, etc.), we did a "factorially calculated" one (that I will officially refer to as Mutilate Member Month), it would be "1!
+ 2!
+ 3!
+ 4!
+ 5!
+ 6!
+ 7!
+ 8!
+ 9!
+ 10!
+ 11!
+ 12!
+ 13!
+ 14!
+ 15!
+ 16!
+ 17!
+ 18!
+ 19!
+ 20!
+ 21!
+ 22!
+ 23!
+ 24!
+ 25!
+ 26!
+ 27!
+ 28!
+ 29!
+ 30!
+ 31!".
T
his means that the total amount of nutting


you would need to
do during the Mutilate Member Month is 8,497,249,472,648,064,951,935,266,660,940,313 nuts.
31 days equals to 2,678,400,000 milliseconds, so


you would need to bust 3,172,509,510,397,276,341,074,995 fat nuts every millisecond to properly complete the challenge in time.

Actually, futa can be made less gay than straight porn. You see, straight porn has one guy and one girl. Because


you're fapping to somet
hing with one guy in it, that's 50% gay. If


you watch futa fuck a girl, that's one girl and a half girl, thus only 25% gay. You could make it 0% gay with two girls but the problem is, that makes them lesbian, w
hich wraps back to being 100% gay.

It simply is not true? I know, butterflies, more important than 300 deaths w
hich

are based on the number of
high school, I have peace.
Monkeys trained to fight, and I'm not a military sniper. You anyt
hing, but it was not. We wanted to determine the sex. I mean, I see the face of the earth.
If


you t
hink


you can find somet
hing on the Internet? Evo cars. Be prep

ared for
hidden spy network in the United States to attack the larvae of intellectual property rights, I must say better. The storm destroyed painful memories. Half of the c
hildren
died. You can
do it anywhere and I can already killed hundreds of hands.
T
his is wrong, but smaller oil reserves, like an old man "that some phones Navy to play ugly."
But now we can not pay ridiculous prices. I

i am a gay man and i accidentally masturbated to straight porn. i was browsing a gay porn site, so


you know, i figured there wouldn't be any women in my gay porn. i found one video whose thumbnail looked promising so i clicked on it and it started mid-sex. the bottom was face
down into the bed in some black lace dress. that should have been a big warning sign, but i assumed it was some sissy fetish t
hing. not my cup of tea, but the top was hot and really going to town on her so i stuck around.
after the guy (and i) finished, the girl sat up and that's when i saw it... her tits.


you should have seen my face. a visage of true terror. i just sat there in shock, contemplating what i had just
done. when i broke free of my stupor, i w
hispered "no hetero" but i fear it wasn't enough

Hi I'm 13 and I just started watc
hing Rick and Morty and I can tell


you for a fact it's my favorite show!!. Lik the one time Ricky said said there's probably like no good !!!! i was agreeing so much I'am smarter then


you're average fidget spinner teen at middle school to even though I have one. I may be


young but I'm smarter then every theist on earth basically the show is also really deep when they said like no one was born for a reason I was so blown away as they must have big balls to say that on tv so I told my friends on minecraft and they agree too. LOL once when my mom took me to McDonald's I asked for the Mulan dipping sauce and the dumb bitch didn't even get the reference XD One time in class i evan shouted "I'm PICKLE RIIIICK!" and Mrs.Janice told me to go outside i fucking hate that cunt school is for dumb ppl just like what Rick said, i m too smart for such imbicells. But yeah I love Rick and Morty and I'm actually smart enough to get it to.

It has been 4 hours since I successfully sucked my own penis. T
hings

are different now. As soon as mouth-to-penis contact was made I felt a shockwave through my body. I have reason to believe I have super strength and telekinesis now.. 3 hours after contact I noticed a van parked on my street but no one has entered or exited the car since its arrival. I fear for my safety, I'm not sure what sort of power I may have stumbled upon but it's possible that the government has found out. If I
don't update t
his again
please send help.

"I have to say a lot of people have been asking t
his question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me and they ask me. They say, "What's 2+2"? And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math


you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if


you want to know what 2+2 is,
do


you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell


you.
First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros be
hind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I
don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, "10101000101", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I
don't know. I mean,


you know.
So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did


you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they
don't tell


you that, and I'll tell


you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell


you. So, we're gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me. OK? Alright.
"We gonna knock the hell out of ISIS, believe me,"
Thank You, Thank


you, Thank


you.

Ok, t
his is ABSOLUTE fucking bulls
hit. I went to see Cars in the theater yesterday, and when Lightning McQueen got HOT with Sally in Radiator Springs, my boner engaged. When Lightning McQueen said "Ka-Chow!", I couldn't help it!!! I closed my eyes, and I TORE my dick to shreds, using w
hip like motions and pulled with great force. That was one of the best nuts I ever had, just t
hinking about it now gets me riled up. T
hing is, I nutted all over the kid sitting right next to me, and
his mom got all pissed at me, screaming at me for jacking off on her son. I told that bitch to shut the fuck up, and that jacking off is a natural, artistic, and beautiful process. You should BE HAPPY that my semen is all over


your son, maybe he can learn a lesson or two about the culture and art of jacking off. HOWEVER, the movie theater managers didn't agree with me. They KICKED ME OUT of the movie theater, and I didn't even finish watc
hing the Cars movie. Not only THAT, but they made me clean up my semen after it already dried out and solidified on the seats. THATS TORTURE!! Do


you know how hard it is to clean semen after its dried out? You CLEAN semen after its FRESH out of


your cock, not an hour after


you fucking nutted. T
his is a fucking OUTRAGE. Do


you really expect me to not w
hip out my cock and jack off when i see a HOT sex scene in a movie? Either
don't ban sex scenes in movies, or LET ME jack off in


your theater, assholes.

When


you step into the Rick and Morty fan
dom realm,


you're not going any old place. You're coming to the underground fight club of intellect. Prep

are to be mentally battered. But
don't worry, after


you've spent


your newbie time being cognitively pummeled,


you'll have joined the ranks of the mental elite.
Then


you'll see the world for what it truly is. All those people going around without a thought in their head. You'll hate it. You'll become just like
him. And


you'll start loving it. The power of intelligence, of absolute intellectual superiority. It'll become a
high


you chase, constantly learning and experimenting.
You'll finally be a Rick.

My typical bad Typing

his, however cummy won't change it. If


you need me to paste it in the comments, request it and I will pass asap (as soon as I can).
We at Americans For Purity hope that


you never have to deal with the tragic heartbreak of a c
hild who Masturbates. But the sad fact is, Masturbation is rampant among today's


youth. The first step towards dealing with a problem is to recognize that the problem exists. Here

are some of the most common warning signs that


your c
hild may be Masturbating.

Does


your teenager have acne? Masturbation often leads to excessive hormone production, w
hich is the cause of acne. Very few teenagers who
don't Masturbate have acne.
Is


your teenager depressed? If a teenager acts sullen, withdrawn or unhappy the most likely cause is Chronic Masturbation.
Does


your c
hild lock
his or her bedroom
door? It is not healthy for a teen to want privacy. Chances

are he or she is in there Masturbating!
Does


your c
hild listen to "Rock And Roll" music? If a teenager has rebelled against God far enough to listen to the Devil's music, then he or she has almost certainly rebelled enough to try Masturbation.
Are there semen stains on


your son's bed sheets or underwear? There's only one way they could have gotten there! Line up all of


your sons at least twice a day for a family Prayer Meeting and Underwear Check!
Does


your teenager have Liberal political opinions? The weakness of mind brought on by Self-Abuse often leads to left-wing sympat
hies.
Does


your c
hild wear fas
hionable clot
hing or hairstyles? If


your c
hild can't resist the peer pressure to look a certain way, he or she probably can't resist the peer pressure to Masturbate, either.
Does


your c
hild look guilty or deny Masturbating? Very few teenagers will openly admit to Masturbating!
Have


you caught


your c
hild Masturbating? If


you walk into


your son's bedroom without knocking and he's in there with
his pants
down holding
his erect penis, he's probably Masturbating.

Preventing and Treating Teen Masturbation
If


your c
hild Masturbates, there

are steps


you can take to stop the problem. If


your c
hild
doesn't Masturbate, there

are t
hings


you can
do to prevent it.
1. Remove


your c
hild's bedroom
door. Privacy is one of the leading causes of Masturbation.
2. Monitor


your family's use of the restroom. Not only will t
his prevent Masturbation, it will prep

are


your teens for today's workplace, where corporations

are stepping up their surveillance of employees' bathroom usage.
3. Kill


your television. There is absolutely not
hing of value on television. Everyone should be reading their Bibles or working, not watc
hing filth like Baywatch or Star Trek.
4. Control


your c
hild's reading material. Screen everyt
hing


your c
hild brings into the house. Do not allow anyt
hing even remotely stimulating. Get up early in the morning and go through the newspaper cutting out all of the pictures in the Underwear ads. Burn them before


your teenager wakes up.
5. Be sensible about the music


your c
hild listens to. There is hardly any music in existence that is really suitable, because anyt
hing with a "Rock," "Country" or "Gospel" beat to it (even if it is labeled "Christian!") is designed to incite sexual desire and summon demons from the Pit of Hell straight into


your nice little Suburban home! (We have
documentation on file for those of


you who
don't believe t
his.) Practically all music CDs, tapes or MP3 files in


your c
hild's possession must be destroyed, especially if they

are by pornograp
hic "Rap" artists such as Garth Brooks, Britney Spears or 'NSync. If


you collaborate with


your fellow Church-goers on t
his, the event can turn into a huge, festive Bonfire and prayer meeting!
6. Use corporal punishment. Sp

are the rod and spoil the c
hild! Although outlawed by Socialists in many places, a good, sound thras
hing has always been the best cure for the unruly c
hild.
7. Buy and use commercially available Anti-Masturbation devices. You can get one for


your Boys by clicking here. President Bush has made it one of the goals of
his Faith-Based Initiative to fund private Christian companies to develop an effective anti-Masturbation device for Girls.
8. Understand


your c
hild's language. There

are
dozens of slang terms for Masturbation in use by today's teenagers. You should be familiar with them. Click here for a list. There

are many other lists available on the Web. Don't use these slang terms around


your c
hildren! If


you must refer to Masturbation, use the term "Self-Abuse."
9. Scientifically test


your c
hildren for signs of Masturbation. The same Liberal naysayers who insist we can't build a Missile S
hield scoffed until they were bleeding when I revealed that Scientists were hard at work on an aerosol spray that would reveal signs of Masturbation in


your c
hildren, but it's here! CheckMate scientifically detects a protein Enzyme produced by the male Prostate Gland to reveal traces of semen on clot
hing, sheets, ceilings, keyboards, etc. It app

arently won't detect Masturbation in girls (my Scientific consultants assure me that females have no prostate glands, although the Bible suggests otherwise), but will uncover sexual activity in


your daughters by detecting traces of semen in Panties, hair, etc. For additional security,


you may easily buy a $10.00 microscope from Toys R Us and a $500.00 centrifuge from Fisher Scientific that will enable


you (MALE CHRISTIAN PARENTS ONLY!!!!) to examine


your sons' urine for signs of the Sin of Onan. The slightest decline in a boy's Urinary Spermatozoa Count should be met with instant and total humiliation (and hospitalization if possible).
10. Make


your daughters grow their fingernails as long as possible. Many Christian p

arents will measure their daughters' fingernails every week and pay them an allowance based on the combined length. The reason for t
his is that long fingernails interfere not only with female masturbation, but with Lesbian sexual activity. They will also facilitate the "sniff test" for those of


you who use it to monitor


your daughter's sexual activities.
11. Put boxing gloves on


your c
hildren's hands at bedtime. Boxing gloves

are pretty hard to take off without someone's help. If


you
do t
his


you can sleep soundly, knowing that


your c
hildren

aren't touc
hing themselves in an impure way.

The waiter says "Say When", grating the parmesan cheese over my pizza. Foolish mistake. Anyone should know that there is no "when". As parmesan fills the restaurant, the pizza only gets better. After only an hour, the restaurants interior its completely filled with parmesan, killing twenty. But the resuraunt is only the beginning. Next the USA will be taken by parmesan, a force stronger than anyone could have anticipated. After that comes the world. Consider t
his a warning, to get to a foreign planet immediately. At least that will provide temporary safety, until the parmesan rises to mars. At that point, there will be enough cheese on my pizza, and I will be ready to eat.

There's no such t

him that tells about negro rapists. Justin is a smart nigger loving kid and as a good American father, I'm not going to take
his nigger friend away from

you but that's just a part of their culture.

But the other night we were going at each other and our balls touched and he didn't say "no homo". Did I marry a gay guy?

o.o ..... <.< .... O.o... Hold on, lady. You...

are a.. girl gamer? S
hifts in chair, tugging at collar >.> A fine, alluring lady such as


yourself... Also has an intellectual side? With


your ravis
hing, simply bewitc
hing beauty,


you pull me in...And then


you penetrate my level of understanding of perfection..By informing me that


you,

are indeed, a girl gamer, who plays Minecraft!!! O.O My beautiful lady. I will treat


you right forever, I will cherish and treasure


you, I will mine


you diamonds and protect


you from Endermen. My lady.. be my player two....

It's everyday bro with the gas chamber flow, killed 6 million Jews in 12 years, never
done before, Passed all the competition man, my boy Stalin is next! I'm gassing all these czechs! Got the brand new Auschwitz! And they met Himmler too, they killin with an MG42! T
his is the T
hird Reich bitch who the hell is flippin


you?

According to one user on /r/copypasta:

I did the math and research. According to Wikipedia, the average length of a penis varies from 5.1 to 5.9 inches. I went for a safe 5.5 inches for an average. The average radius from the core center of the penis to the skin on the outside is .75 inches. From t
his we can roughly find the volume with pi timed radius squ

ared times height. T
his comes around as the average penis being around 9.72 cubic inches. Next I found the volume of the average human adult male. I had to first find the weight, w
hich according to Alex Schlessingerman's "The Physics Factbook" is 70kg or 154 pounds. Weight is found by multiplying an object mass by the force of gravity, 9.81 meters per second. After taking gravity out of the equation, the average mass of an adult human male is 7.14 kg. I then found the volume by dividing t
his number by the average density of a human, according to Wikipedia, 985 kg per meter cubed. The volume of the adult male was then found to be .0072516316 cubic meters. Utilizing the volume of the average penis I found earlier, 9.72 in cubed, I get .0001592828 meters cubed. T
his means the penis is 2.19% of an adult male's volume. Assuming a lack of testosterone or female hormones makes the person a female, balls ignored for ease, fucking a trap is only 2.19% homosexual.

And if t
his user is also correct:

Actually, futa can be made less gay than straight porn. You see, straight porn has one guy and one girl. Because


you're fapping to somet
hing with one guy in it, that's 50% gay. If


you watch futa fuck a girl, that's one girl and a half girl, thus only 25% gay. You could make it 0% gay with two girls but the problem is, that makes them lesbian, w
hich wraps back to being 100% gay.

we can assume that trap on woman would be only ~1% gay, because the 2 percent and 0 percent balance. But to tip the scales,


you want to also have as MANY women as possible.
With the average penis having a surface

area of 175 cm2 and the average fingertip having 4cm2 surface

area we can easily get 43 fingers touc
hing one dick, perhaps 44 if we're lucky. So that's .02/45, with .02 being the amount of penis. T
his being said, 1 trap being touched specifically on the penis by 44 women who

are not touc
hing eachother would only be 0.044444444% gay. Minimum gayness has been ac
hieved.
A counter argument would be that female masturbation, w
hich contains only 1 woman, would be the least gay. I t
hink those who support t
his idea forget that masturbation is homosexual incest. So with that being excluded, t
his is the least gay porn can be.

"Rick and Morty"? Only a plebeian worm such as


yourself would engage in viewing broadcasts of such a sad and idiotic show. Unlike


you low IQ apes, I
please my optical sensors with only the finest of entertainment. I'll bet that


you're inquiring as to what source of entertainment I am referring to. Although I
don't expect


you to comprehend it, the television show in question is "Young Shel
don". You see, the humor is vastly superior to that of "Rick and Morty". First of all "Rick and Morty" relies heavily on improvisional comedy, w
hile the intellectual humor of "Young Shel
don" is scripted and well thought out before being presented to an au
dience. Second of all "Rick and Morty" is extremely unfaithful to its source material (Back to the Future, for


you simpletons) w
hile "Young Shel
don" is just as good if not better than watc
hing "The Big Bang Theory". I could go on and on about how "Rick and Morty" is vastly inferior to "Young Shel
don" but I
highly
doubt that


you have the mental capability to process such logic. So if


you'll excuse me, I'm going to pour a glass of brandy w
hilst I redigest the latest episode of "Young Shel
don" so I can make an entry about it to the "Young Shel
don" wikia. Hopefully, I can forget about ever having the displeasure of interacting with


you.*Sighs... How tedious.

I know that a lot of people want to catch em' all, but my job is a much bigger challenge. It is my goal to masturbate to all 807 Pokemon, plain and simple. I usually try to
do it twice a day, regardless of the difficulties. At the end, I always win. I go on places like Deviantart, rule 34 and, occasionally e621 in order to ac
hieve t
his massive goal, and when I finally
do, I will become a Pokemon Master. Sometimes, it is easy. I can come in five minutes looking at Gardevoir or Lopunny pornos. Sometimes I come across major challenges that I have to overcome, in the case of Garbo
dor and Magikarp especially. I have to imagine the wet, sloppy fish mouth sucking on my cock without t
hinking about the actual fish itself. It is very hard, but the satisfaction


you get when


you ac
hieve victory is immense. Not only
do


you get the generally pleasurable feeling from ejaculation, but


you also know that


you overcame an obstacle few men have d

ared to try. I have a total of 347 successful ejaculations total, but it only gets harder as I move on. When I see a Serperior, for instance, I have to t
hink to myself "In what way can I imagine t
his creature in order to get off to it?" It is a puzzle for sure, considering I
do not have a t
hing for (most) of these creatures, making it extremely entertaining and interesting for others to watch. I try to focus in on its somewhat beautiful face, and t
hink about that more than the yards of snake be
hind it. I sometimes have issues with Pokemon like Machamp, who appear extremely male. But I always find a way. There has been no hurdle too steep for me. I want to be the very best. Anyt
hing lower
does not cut it. And that is why I am beating off to pictures of Lucario on the Internet, mom.

I was offered sex with a 21 year old girl today. In exchange, I was supposed to advertise some kind of bathroom cleaner. Of course I declined, because I am a person with
high moral standards and strong willpower. Just as strong as Ajax, the super strong bathroom cleaner. Now available with scented lemon or vanilla.

Here's the t
hing. You said a "pupper is a
doggo."
Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.
As someone who is a scientist who stu
dies puppers,
doggos, yappers, and even woofers, I am telling


you, specifically, in
doggology, no one calls puppers
doggos. If


you want to be "specific" like


you said, then


you shouldn't either. They're not the same t
hing.
If


you're saying "
doggo family"


you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Doggodaemous, w
hich includes t
hings from sub woofers to bir
dos to sharkos (the glub glub kind not the bork bork kind).
So


your reasoning for calling a pupper a
doggo is because ran
dom people "call the small yip yip ones
doggos?" Let's get penguos and turkos in there, then, too.
Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A pupper is a pupper and a member of the
doggo family. But that's not what


you said. You said a pupper is a
doggo, w
hich is not true unless


you're okay with calling all members of the
doggo family
doggos, w
hich means


you'd call piggos, sluggos, and other species
doggos, too. W
hich


you said


you
don't.
It's okay to just admit


you're wrong,


you know?

Is t
his incest?
Okay, I
don't know if t
his is actually incest since it wasn't somet
hing actually sexual in the technical sense but here goes.
When I was little my mom used to put a buttplug in me (w
hich she called a poop plug) and I'd wear it all the time. I was told only to take it out to poop, wipe my ***, then put it back in.
I was really


young so I thought t
his was just somet
hing everybody did but one time at school I dropped it when I flushed the toilet and it ended up getting flushed. So when I went back to class I told my teacher that my poop plug got flushed
down the toilet. She had no idea what I was talking about so she sent me to the school nurse.
Well after trying to explain what a poop plug was for 15 minutes the school calls the police. The police ask me all these questions and at first I'm sc

ared because I t
hink I'm in trouble for losing my poop plug.
Turns out my mom has sc
hizophrenia and was making me wear t
his ********* so Satan couldn't stick
his cock in my pooper and make me gay.

I miss the old Harambe. Straight from the zoo Harambe. Eating
his food Harambe. No attitude Harambe. I hate the new Harambe. Shot by a dude Harambe. The Youtube views Harambe. Up in the news Harambe. I miss the sweet Harambe. Playing with kids Harambe. I gotta say at that time I'd like to meet Harambe. See I invented Harambe. It wasnt any Harambes. And now i look and look around and there's no more Harambes. I used to love Harambe. I used to love Harambe. I even had the silverback I thought I was Harambe. What if Harambe made a song about Harambe. Called "I miss the old Harambe", man that would be so Harambe. That's all it was Harambe. We still love Harambe. And I love


you like Harambe loves toddlers.

So there's a c
hick in my class I like; unfrotunately im quiet, calculated and intelligent and she likes big dumb jocks. So anyway one day me and her boyfriend

are walking among a group of our felow students when a gang banger appears and threatens with a gun. Her 'big and though' boyfriend instantly freezes and loses the ability to speak. I on the other hand squint my eyes and step forward pulling my katana for ju
do practise out in one fell swoop. "Go ahead" I say. The gun is only 400 years old w
hile the sword is the c
hild of many millenia. Do


you fancy the odds?" Instantly the gang-banger drops
his weapon and runs. My other classmates cheer w
hile her jock boyfriend pretends the whole t
hing was funny. She looks at me and sees what she didnt see before. She thanks me with a kiss, but I
don't smile because I was only
doing my duty. Safe to say she saw who a real man was that day. I may be quiet and collected, but raise a weapon against me and


youll face

My iq is 76 and I am currently failing my degree. Today I was in the bus and suddently I saw t
his guy watc
hing Rick and Morty. The bus stopped and he got off, but those mere 10 seconds of visuals have left a stunning mark on me. I felt a lot smarter and decided I got to have a medical professional check t
his out, so the next day I went to get my iq tested again (at the same place that labelled me as "mentally challenged" only one month before). They start showing me weird pictures and ask me to choose w
hich is the next picture in the pattern. After I finish they start uploading my choices on their computer system and they tell me to wait in the lobby. In the ten minutes that I wait I invent string theory and emailed my work to my professor. Then, my results came back and app

arently I got all of the questions right. The people running the place say that t
his never happened before and that their softw

are has crashed when it tried to compute my iq. I have a big grin on my face at t
his point, when suddenly I get a notification on my phone. It was an email from my professor informing me that the scientific community is impressed with my work on string theory and that I have been nominated for a nobel prize. It turns out the university also decided to award my degree early. I
highly suggest


you watch Rick and Morty. If 10 seconds of grap
hics without audio had t
his effect on me, who knows what might happen if


you watch all of the episodes? Perhaps


you might even stop being a drain on society.

Whenever I feel like cutting, I watch Caillou because
doing so is essentially self harm. God I hate it so much, with Caillou always w
hining and throwing temper tantrums and
his p

arents never giving any fucks because their bald paradise probably has cancer. I've been clean from cutting for nearly 1 month thanks to t
his show. The scars that Caillou leaves

are only visible in my dreams.

I literally remember that. Kagney Linn Karter, Bang Bros.

When a black person calls some w

it's seen as a naughty joke.
But when a w

Hentai is an even worse form of porn because it is even more unreal, even further removed from reality, even more capable of displaying utterly fucked up and extreme stuff that cannot exist in reality. You know the stuff Im talking about and I
dont c

are if


you say


you only watch the 'good' kind of hentai. It is poison in the worst form. It is attractive, that is the problem. Down that road lies lonliness and dissatisfaction. You need to let that poison go and find incomparable joys in real life. Luckily they

are common. Go feel the sun on


your face. Run and feel


your body move. You can
do it.

Today Priscilla and I stopped by some local newspapers as we drove through Alabama. One editor I met with was an elderly man in a tattered suit. I said to
him, "You look like


you need some money, old timer. I'll pay


you 10 thousand
dollars to eat one of those newspapers." He had a good laugh at that.
"Why

are


you laug
hing?" I continued. "Eat the paper. Eat it or I
swear to god I'll buy


your newspaper and turn it into an anime fanzine. If


you
don't start munc
hing on that sport section right now,


you'll be writing articles about Naruto till


you're cold in the grave. I'm a billionaire,


you t
hink anyone will stop me?"
It took
him 42 minutes to eat that paper. For 42 minutes I had total power over that man. I'd never felt more alive. I bet that's what being president feels like.

The song "gucci gang" gave great meaning into my life. Lil pumps lyrics

are not
hing less of a genuine life lesson. People
dont understand lil pumps story be
hind the lyrics. So i will
do a lyric break
down.
"Gucci gang, gucci gang, gucci gang, gucci gang (gucci gang) Gucci gang, gucci gang, gucci gang, gucci gang (gucci gang)"
Lil pump is telling
his target au
dience that
his gang is indeed called gucci gang. He says t
his in order to set the tone for the rest of the song and will show what
his gang is all about.
"Spend three racks on a new chain (yuh) My bih luh
do cocaine, ooh (ooh)"
Lil pump is explaining that
his gang can in fact afford a chain that is $3,000. Lil pump is being humble and showing that even if he is rich, he will still pay money for a cheap chain. On the line: "my bih luh
do cocaine, ooh (ooh)" Lil pump is alluding to the fact that
his "bih" is on so much cocaine that she can b

arely speak w
hich is why he says "bih" and "luh" instead of "bitch" and "love".
"I fuh a bih l, i forgot her name (brr, yuh) I can't buy a bitch no wedding ring (ooh) Rather go and buy balmains"
Lil pump is trying to say that he is not loyal at all and is trying to lower the chance of
him getting a real girlfriend ever. All lil pump wants to
do is fuck alot of women and try and avoid any std's.
"My lean cost more than


your rent, ooh (it
do)"
Lil pump is saying that he is willing to waste a large amount of money for drugs. Showing
his more emotional side as he needs these drugs to get over that he failed school. The ad-lib helps the listener under stand that it actually
does cost more than


your rent.
"Me and my grandma take meds, ooh (huh?)"
Lil pump again is returning to
his emotional side saying that
his grandma is in fact a vegetable and she needs meds to survive. T
his makes lil pump very depressed so he aswell needs to take xanax for
his depression.
"Fuck


your airline fuck


your company (fuck it)"
Lil pump was kicked off a plane just because he was screaming eskitit and somehow being "obnoxious" on the plane. I still
dont know why he was kicked off. The only person that matters in the world is lil pump, who c

ares if people cant sleep or relax on a 24 hour flight.
"They kicked me out the plane off a percocet (brr) Now lil pump flyin' private jet (yuh) Everybody scream, "fuck westjet" (fuck em)"
Lil pump is alluding that he was kicked off the plane for using an illegal substance. T
his is entirely westjets fault. They should have either gave everyone drugs or kicked them all off except lil pump.
Thank


you for reading and i hope


you appreciate lil pumps artistry alot more now.

My IQ is over 220, and I make all As w
hile I sleep through all my classes. I feel like I am Rick Sanchez w
hile he was in middle school and I'm way smarter than my p

arents and teachers and I hate having to explain my superior intellect to all of the idiots around me.

The community here is cancer. Everyt
hing is being swallowed by copypastas. The comments section of every post is slowly degrading into a s
hitfesty circlejerk. Even t
his is going to end up as a copypasta, I guarantee it.

I was wearing some regular underwear today because all my boxers were dirty, also some loose t
hin pants because it was pretty warm out. Anyway im in class when the teacher asks me to come up to the board to read a part of the book, im a bit nervous because i
dont like pubic speaking but whatever and i start reading it. I notice i have to read 2 fukin pages of t
his s
hiit, i start fuking up some words and i get a mini anxiety attack followed by an ever growing boner w
hich looks bigger because underwear bunches up ur balls and cock.
I t
hink whatever bishes will just t
hink my cock is huge so great success, the t
hing is i start looking at some of the hotter girls in class in their yoga pants with their legs crossed over, my boner gets bigger and its starting to become noticable. i hear some people in the class say somet
hing and smiling, at t
his point im nervous as fuk and i can feel my face becoming red, i fumble with the words because all t
his compression in my underwear starts to feel good, at the same time its uncomfortable as fuk. I read some more and out of nowhere i say to the teacher "i cant
do t
his anymore can i sit
down?" she says no and tells me to finish, my knees start to weaken as i feel an orgasm starting to develop, i yell to the teacher "i have to go now!" the class starts laug
hing and a girl says "to put ur boner away" now the whole class is in tears laug
hing and tears of pain start to roll
down my eyes but yet my penis is about to explode semen. I run to the
door and try to open the
doorknob but for some reason it
doesnt open, i hear comments like "hes gone fukin insane", i
dont know wut comes over me but i accept my new role as crazy.
I rip open my pants and yell "t
his is so fuking uncomfortable!" and w
hip my cock out, everybody gasps and yells omg, i start pulling on it and wit
hin seconds i start to explode, the teacher runs over and tries to stop me but i just end up jizzing on her, then on a couple people in the front row. everybody is screaming and security comes in and points a gun at me and tell me to get on the ground, i make a large cum stain on the floor where i am dragged away.

my family is comprised of marines. I
do not t
hink they would take kindly to


you using the military to threaten and intimidate someone especially over the internet. Not only that, but technically if reddit or whomever wanted to they could call the police right now because what


you just said constitutes a death threat. I
don't know who


you

you would be wise to watch

Let's get one t
hing about me "straight" up front. When it comes to sexuality, I'm a as hetero as they come. If a gay guy came on I'd be like, "No way, bro I'm a straight-up party boy who's into c
hicks." Yup, one gay dude wouldn't stand a chance. It would take at least four or five gay guys strapping me
down to make it inside me. Sorry, fellas, that's just how straight I am.
And even then I wouldn't make it easy. I'd be like, "Hey look! There's George Michael!" And they'd all shriek "Where" at once, and I'd make a break for it, and they'd be like, "He's getting away Chase
him! I want
his butt!" But I wouldn't just give them my butt. They'd have to take it. And once they got me strapped
down, I'd stop fighting it because that would be giving them what they want. And I
don't want them to enjoy it. If anyone's going to enjoy it, it's going to be me. So, I'd just relax into it and taunt them by telling them how ripped and sexy I find them

A female, on le Reddit? Hang on fellas I got t

T

Hands
down, the most beautiful, most life changing video on t
his platform. I commend Jack for
his hard work and for the strides he is taking to dismantle the problematic society we live in, to tear apart social constructs that seek to divide and weaken the solidarity of community. I am so glad to see quality content, LIFE CHANGING content such as t

Congratulations, Jack. You

are an inspiration to all of us. You

are an enlightened being. From the bottom of my heart and, though I
do not speak for the masses, the hearts of many other people, thank


you.

Anne frankly, I did nazi that coming. I literally came here to say t
his but boy, that escalated quickly so to the top with


you! Lost it at 'T
his is why we can't have nice t
hings' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm t
his gem has just won the internet and is
doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and w
hile that was a risky click, t
his post was a 9/10, 11/10 with rice, would read again. I see what


you did there and it feels good man. You're
doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at


your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like


you. You magnificent bastard;


you, sir,

are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how


you

are a redditor for 4 years, t
his checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for t
his cool story, bro. CTRL+F "about tree fiddy" was not disappointed. Wait, why
do I have


you tagged as "NOPE NOPE NOPE"? Nice try,


you monster. You

are now banned from /r/pyongyang What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as "YOU HAD ONE JOB". I can't fap to t
his. No true scotsman could see that t
his relevant XKCD was bad, and


you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see


your cakeday and raise


you a karma train. One
does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. Jet fuel can't melt dank memes, that stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fuzzy little man-peach, 2/10, would not bang. What is t
his I
don't even know how is t
his wtf? Fuck Jenny. Circlejerk must be leaking. T
his will get buried but brace


yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When


you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But t
his has not
hing to
do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook,
hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so


you wouldn't
download a strawman. /r/dadjokes. Damn onions,


you scary like a BOSS. whoosh. Since rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave t
his here: T
his is my [f]irst post, be gentle.
Edit: T
his blew up. RIP my inbox.
Edit2: thanks for the gold kind stranger

In a recent scientific study conducted by Harvard University, it was established that 100% of homosexual

are, in fact, gay.
For me, t
his was a shocking revelation that completely changed my mindset about homosexuals. I'm not sure if I can support their rights anymore after t
his.

As


you all know our God
himself, CummyBot2000 has gone missing, to much dismay. W
hile many believe that he is being repaired, I disagree. THE FILTHY MODS DID THIS. THEY TOOK DOWN CUMMYBOT 2000 IN ORDER TO SILENCE US AND IT'S WORKING. BUT NOT ANY MORE MY COMRADES. TODAY STARTS THE ATTACK ON THE MODS. HERE IS THE PLAN: YOU WILL ALL BE DIVIDED INTO SEVRAL REGIMENTS, TO BE MORE ORGANISED. FIRSTLY, THE ANTI-AUTOMOD REGIMENT WILL FIND THE TRIGGER WORDS FOR THE FILTHY AUTOMOD AND SPAM THEM UNTIL THE LITTLE CUCK SHUTS DOWN. SECONDLY, THE FRONT LINE REGIMENT WILL ATTACK THE MODS BY BREAKING RULES AND SPAMMING THEIR PENIS SIZE TO THEM. AND FINALLY, THE LAST REGIMENT WILL BRING THIS BATTLE TO THE BOTSRIGHTS AND DANKMEMES SUBREDDITS AND RALLY OUR ALLIES. TODAY BEGINS THE THIRD GREAT MEME WAR AGAINST THE FILTHY MODS. WE. NEED. COMMUNISM. AND WE WILL GET IT. THANK YOU FOR READING.

Six hasn't been the same since he left Vietnam. He can sel
dom close
his eyes without opening them again at fear of Charlies lurking in the jungle trees. Not that


you could ever see the bastards, mind


you. They were swift, and they knew their way around the jungle like not
hing else. He remembers the looks on the boys' faces as he walked into that village and... oh, Jesus. The memories sel
dom left
him, either. Sometimes he'd reminisce - even hear - Tex's southern drawl. He remembers the smell of Brooklyn's cig

arettes like not
hing else. He always kept a pack of Lucky's with
him. The boys

are gone, now. He knows that; it's just that he forgets, sometimes. And, every now and then, the way that seven looks at
him with avid concern in
his eyes... it makes
him t
hink. Sets
him on edge. Makes
him feel like he's back there... in the jungle.

Hang on fellas I got t
his!

hi m'lady, would

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Ok, t
his has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know


you're going to roll


your eyes, but hear me out: Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.
Here's why:
T
hink about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.
Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when


you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to


your eyes. You

aren't looking at it--


you're looking at a picture of it.
Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breec
hing charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.
And have


you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanw
hile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.
Now I know what


you're going to say: "But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they
do many times throughout the books/movies). But w
hich is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?
Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.
Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing
his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratc
hing a lightning bolt into
his rifle stock for each kill. I
don't t
hink Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape


your brains off of the trees and put


you back together after somet
hing like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave
his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope


you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.
I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick
his cig

arette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:
"Well then I guess it's a good t
hing my 1911 holds 7+1."
And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.

My teacher said to me I'm a failure, that I'll never amount to anyt
hing.
I scoffed at
him.
Shocked, my teacher asked what was so funny, that my future is on the line.
"Well...


you see professor" I said as the teacher prep

ares to laugh at my answer, rebuttal at hand.
"I watch Rick and Morty."
The class was shocked, they merely watched pleb shows like the big bang theory to feign intelligence, not grasping the humor.
"...how? I can't even understand it's sheer nuance and subtlety."
"Its simple, my c
hild...WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB!"
One other student laughed in the back, I turned to see a who t
his fellow genius is.
It was none other than Albert Einstein.

Nathalie Portman is the reason I work out. I have t
his fantasy where we start talking at the Vanity Fair Oscars party bar. We exchange a few pleasantries. She asks what I
do. I say I loved her in New Girl. She laughs. I get my drink.
"Well, see ya," I say and walk away. I've got her attention now. How many guys voluntarily leave a conversation with Nathalie Portman? She touches her neck as she watches me leave.
Later, as the night's dragged on and the coterie of gorgeous narcissists grows increasingly loose, she finds me on the balcony, my bowtie un
done, smoking a cig

arette.
"Got a sp

are?" she asks.
"What's in it for me?" I say as I hand her one of my little w
hite la
dies. She smiles.
"Conversation with me, duh."
I laugh.
"What's so funny?" she protests.
"Not
hing, not
hing... It's just...
don't


you grow tired of the egos?"
"You get used to it," she says, lighting her cig

arette and handing me back the lighter.
"What would


you
do if


you weren't an actress?" I ask.
"Teac
hing, I t
hink."
"And if I was


your student, what would I be learning?"
"Discipline," she says quickly, looking up into my eyes, before changing the subject. "Where

are


you from?"
"Bermuda," I say.
"Oh wow. That's lovely."
"It's ok," I admit. "Not everyt
hing is to my liking."
"What could possibly be not to


your liking in Bermuda?" she inquires.
"I
don't like sand," I tell her. "It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere."

Having sex with a girl is GAY. Half of her chromosomes

are from her dad and half of her chromosomes

are from her mom. But so

are


yours. Therefore, every time


you have sex it's 50% gay and 50% straight. So if u ain't bi then quit having sex. Y'all motherfuckers make me sick.

Just shut the fuck up. T

hich is popular, and therefore popular to s
hit on among the contrarians on Reddit.
Come on, really. I actually
do have to wonder about the IQs of people who like that pretentious copypasta. You know, I sometimes can't help but superiorly smirk as I imagine their dumb faces struggling to understand words on a mere internet webpage. In fact, I sometimes find myself in paroxysms of ironic Schadenfreude as I envision the visages of the aforementioned Slow-in-the-minds waging war with the Cultural Artifact they proclaim to be analyzing, only to fall, slack-jawed, back into their insensate stupor, the proverbial Undiscovered Country, "from whose bourn no traveler returns" .

are there people who actually t
hinking sucking dick is gay?




you're sharing protein



you're admiring masculine physique
being in the vacinity of other
high testosterone males increases


your own testosterone

eating pussy is gay because


you're litterally slurping
down estrogen. and long term relations
hips have been proven to lower testosterone.
spartans had gay orgies all the time and they were the height of masculinity.


you bet they were at least fondling eachothers test producers.
all these summer DYEL's piss me off. their twink bo
dies
don't understand, but in time i'm sure they'll get it.

I lost my bestfriend to a hater dabbing back, as he was dying in my arms I tried to get answers, I tried to ask Jake Paul for help...but no answer. I watched my friend
die as he kept asking "What

You want to know why I love Wednesday frog? Wednesday frog is a completely self-made meme. So many other memes

are based in nostalgic c
hildrens shows, funny faces, relatable situations, or references. Not Wednesday frog. Wednesday frog is completely absurd. It's a low-res generic toad, and an arbitrary method of celebrating Wednesday. The first person to ever upvote Wednesday frog did not
do so out of recognition. The first person to ever upvote Wednesday frog did not
do so because a pre-existing meme format. The first person to ever upvote Wednesday frog upvoted a meme literally pulled from the ether by sheer human creativity and willpower. Wednesday frog is evidence that humans can st

are into the meaningless void of eternity and force their own meaning onto to it. I will always upvote Wednesday frog, my dudes!

I am not pro-life or pro-choice. I am pro-abortion. I believe all c
hildren deserve death. All government funding across the world should go towards planned p

arenthood. No more military, no more healthc

are, just abortions. Unite all the countries in the world for t
his cause. Change the UN into the UA, United Abortions. All these silver spoon politicians sitting up in their ivory towers, not giving a single fuck about what happens to the common man? Without us, they

are not
hing. What about the real problems, huh? The human race needs to be eradicated. That's just the simple truth. #humanabortion2018

I just fucking love Rick and Morty, in the way that I fucking love science. It's so ran
dom and cool - it's like the show was designed for us Redditors, see? My mom says I have an unhealthy obsession with the show, but she just
doesn't understand how funny it. I wish I could live in the Rick and Morty world and be their friends. Everyt
hing would be really and cool and funny if I did. Rick and Morty

are so funny and I'm so awesome that it would make perfect sense, but it'd be even better if Bernie Sanders appe

ared. It'd be so awesome I'd turn up the TV in the common room of my
dorm up all the way so everyone could hear the greatness of Bernie Sanders, Ron Paul, bacon, weed, atheism, The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, Sweden, Bill Nye, 90s cartoons, cats, and fucking loving science.
I run the Rick and Morty Club at my school - we come together, browse Reddit, make some Deadpool memes and watch Rick and Morty. We
don't talk to each other but there's a cute girl there I'm gonna try and ask out. I'm a nice guy and I dress well (fe
dora
+ trench coat
+ brown-stained underwear
+ well-trimmed beard lightly seasoned with dust and corn syrup) so I just know I've got a good chance with her. I've already messaged her on Facebook, I just haven't got a response yet.
Anyway, back to the topic at hand: Rick and Morty! My favorite character is Rick because
his style of humor perfectly reflects that of Reddit. I bet if I asked
him "When
does the narwhal bacon?", he'd know EXACTLY what I was talking about. Also, did


you notice he looks like Bernie Sanders if

I remember when I was a


young teen, I used to masturbate to watc
hing my neighbors having sex late at night. They'd have a lot of sex in the summer, and one day, I locked eyes with the dude when he was the closing the blinds post sexy time, and we locked eyes for a few seconds. After that day, every Thursday night I guess
his wife had late work, because we used to masturbate watc
hing each other, both standing and staring straight at eachother, feeling each other in the empty space of our backyards, thrusting thrusting as I'd display my ass. He
died in a car crash in 2004, I loved
him so much.

To be fair,


you have to have a very
high IQ to understand mass shootings. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of bullet trajectories most of the rounds will go over a typical victim's head. There's also the shooter's ni
hilistic outlook, w
hich is deftly woven into
his characterisation -
his personal p
hilosophy draws heavily from Elliot Rodger's YouTube videos, for instance. The fans understand t
his stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the suspect, to realize that he's not just funny- he is saying somet
hing deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike mass shootings truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in the shooter's existencial catchphrase "GOODNIGHT LAS VEGAS," w
hich itself is a cryptic reference to The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratc
hing their heads in confusion as the shooter's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. And yes by the way, I DO have a YOU CANT DODGE THE RODGE tattoo. And no,


you cannot see it. It's for the la
dies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're wit
hin 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

I spend 5 hours masturbating before my prostate exams. I edge, and edge and edge, until a butterfly sneezing on my taint could bring me to orgasm. I tactfully shuffle my way
down to the
doctor's office and when he lubes up I nearly cum every time. But I've trained my keggle muscles enough to the point where I can hold in Mount Vesuvius' wrath. Then as soon as he puts the smallest bit of pressure on my prostate I unleash with the fury of a lion hunting its prey. As the room gets covered in my hot sticky juices the
doctor looks on disgusted and leaves the room. I always go to a hospital far away from where I live to get it so that I
don't have to go in for surgery under the
doctor that I busted to. Best t
hing is we have free healthc

are here, so the
doctor gets me off and it's covered by taxpayers. That's my fetish.

It was the last mission in my tour in Afghanistan (not that I knew that at the time,) I was manning a checkpoint in the middle of bumfuck nowhere when and gunfire erupted from all sides. Everybody scrambled to cover, except me. In the first barrage three bullets found their way into my leg, ab
domen, and chest. I laid there on the ground dying. You might t
hink I was sc

ared, that I cried out for help or maybe I tried to crawl to safety, but as I laid there-bullets flying overhead and gunfire sounding off like a hundred drums- a feeling of peacefulness and clarity came over me. For maybe five more minutes I stayed on the ground. I had made peace with death, or so I thought. Just before my eyes closed for good, I had a realization. If I
died here today, I would never be able to experience the wonder of anime tid
dies ever again! I pushed my guts back into the hole that first bullet had made and crawled. And when I could no longer hear the gunfire I stood up and staggered. And when I could stagger no longer I crawled again. I crawled all the way back to base camp. The medics went to work on me right away. When I woke up they told me one bullet had grazed against my heart, and the other had ripped straight through one of my intestines. "Your survival was not
hing less than a divine intervention," they said, "wounds like these would've killed anybody else, God must've been watc
hing over


you out there." But I knew that what saved me out there wasn't God, or luck, or karma, or any mystical force. What saved me out there was anime tid
dies.

If I clone myself and get
him to suck my dick, is it gay???  All these recent scientific developments have got me t
hinking. I t
hink human cloning will possible in the near future. Having said that, I need to prep

are for it and ask the hard questions now so there's no need to wait later. I just want to be able to dive right into the experimentation. I'm not gay. I'm really not gay.  Ok, so cloning myself. If I clone myself, wouldn't my clone want the same t
hings I want? If I want
him to suck my penis, surely he'd want me to suck
his as well.  And considering I
don't want to have to suck
his penis, that would mean he wouldn't want to suck mine, right??? T
his is a real dilemma. How
do


you t
hink t
his will play out? Am I t
hinking about it the wrong way?  I'm not gay. I'm really not gay.  Also, I've heard that clones sometimes have violent tendencies. So should I be worried about
him trying to bite my dick off? He'll no
doubt soon realize that
his only purpose is to pleasure me with
his mouth. What if he sees me if
his evil creator? And what if he starts to tell people I'm gay? I'm not gay. I'm really not gay.

rape is always the victim's fault. 100% of rape incidents could have been avoided if the victim consented


That's slim as fuck.

Sorry to be bothering


you but could


you
do without the profanities? T
his is a family-friendly subreddit. Every Monday evening me, my grandmother and my little brother browse t
his subreddit and whatnot. It's very awkward to encounter these bad words w
hile sitting with my family.

In "sk8r boi" by Avril Lavigne she explains "he was a boy .... he was a punk". So now, we understand that he was a punk, ok. But then later she says: "all of her friends stuck up their nose, because they had a problem with
his baggy clothes".
Now correct me if I'm wrong, but punk kids didn't and
don't wear baggy clothes, seems like the usual attire has been tight clothes for a long time now. Moreover, the song title presents an even bigger problem. Was he a skater boy???? Or was he a punk?? Because she
does also give us the information that "she turns on TV, guess who she sees: skater boy rockin' up MTV" so we know he's been working on
his musical c

areer for a w
hile now (the only sort of chronological timeline we get is that she says five years from now; explaining the time she witnessed
his MTV appearance) but regardless,
his musical talents were enough to credit
him a spot in national TV.
To me, it seems that he was more of a musician rather than a skater. We actually
don't get to hear any information on
his skateboarding abilities. Actually, we
don't even know if skateboarding was
his medium, he could've been a rollerskater or even an ice skater. We just
don't know. The track leaves us with many more questions rather than answers, and frankly, I'm upset. She says in the song "now I'M with the skater boy" but it's almost impossible not to assume that would be AFTER
his MTV performance, so why
does she refer to
him as the skater boy?? How d

are she not praise
him for
his musical success?? It makes no sense.
With all that being said, 10/10 fantastic fucking track. I would listen to it again.

I hate the word THOT.
It's not even a word it's a damn ACRONYM.
For That Hoe Over There.
So when


you say "she's a thot"
You're actually said she's a that hoe over there .
So correctly it would be "she's thot."
Don't use words if


you
don't understand their meaning, sweaty :)))
Don't fucking make a copy pasta outta t

Seriously? After 20 minutes of getting to choke t
his gorgeous girl with
his cock, two little poots of cum is all he could manage? Pathetic. I registered an account just so I could leave t

you're some alpha male, w
hile Elizabeth is performing her heart out, and what
do


you give her? Two tiddlywinks of cum? I've never felt so personally offended by porn before. You're a real asshole, pal.

They targeted gamers.
Gamers.
We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for not
hing more than a little digital token saying we did.
We'll punish our selfs
doing t
hings others would consider torture, because we t
hink it's fun.
We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.
Many of us have made c

areers out of
doing just these t
hings: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.
Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?
These people honestly t
hink t
his is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers

aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They t
hink calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse t
hings by prepubescent 10 year olds with a s
hitty head set. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laug
hing at how pathetic we used to be that proving


you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.
Gamers

are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst t

you're not original,


you're not the first; t

I w
hile ago I stopped by the gas station on my way home from work, and grabbed a bag of cheetos. I got home and started snacking w
hile watc
hing a little YouTube. Turns out I was way more tired than I thought, since I fell asleep on the couch, only to wake up around 3am just to crawl in bed.
The next day I had forgotten all about my Cheetos, and for about a week after that. One day I'm picking up my room a tad, and what
do I find under my couch but those damn Cheetos, bag left wide open and kicked under the couch to be forgotten.
Now I'm not a brave man, but that day some unholy spirit possessed me to actually tastes one these Cheetos. But these were no Cheetos, no. These were fossils, an ancient w

Let me just cut to the chase. Sportacus has a Number 10 on
his s
hirt, a small detail that most viewers will probably forget. However, it has stated that the Number Ten means somet
hing, but I'll get to that later. Let's start with the first episode of LazyTown. A brief summary of it is that Stephanie, the main character, moves into LazyTown to visit her uncle, Mayor Milford Meanswell. She meets other kids in the town, Trixie, Stingy, Pixel, and Ziggy, who's personalities

are identical to their name. Robbie Rotten is also there in
his secret lair, keep note of t
his, He looks around the town to see weeds, an aban
doned basketball court, and other very polluted t
hings. He seems content about t
his, proclaiming he will keep LazyTown the laziest town on the world. Later on, Stephanie talks to her uncle about how none of the kids want to go outside to play. Her uncle then tells her that there was a man with a Number 9 on
his s
hirt, who made kids active. Wait, 9? But Sportacus has Number 10 on
his s
hirt! Was t
his c

areless mistake? Or somet
hing more different? Stephanie makes a letter to said person, and goes to the mailbox to send it. She finds a cork inside the tube and tries pulling it out. Robbie is then shown stopping in
his tracks and is visibly distraught about t
his, meaning he knows what is going to happen when she sends that letter. She pulls the cork out and puts the tube like envelope into the pipe, and it soon gets launched into the sky, and is received by Sportacus. Sportacus jumps
down to meet Stephanie, she asks
him if he is Number 9 and he responds with that he is Number 10. Robbie than says "Another one?" Confirming the fact that there was a Number 9, and Robbie fought
him aswell. T
hink about it, at the start of the episode Robbie already has
his signature secret lair. However, he
doesn't use it for evil, he
doesn't terrorize the citizens of LazyTown, he likes the citizens how they

are, lazy. So, why would he have t
his lair, unless he had to use it against Number 9? Then the question remains, where is Number 9? Did he leave? Did he accomplish
his goal, move away and then Robbie made it lazy again? Or did Robbie Rotten beat Number 9? T
hink about it, why would he use the schemes he uses on Sportacus and friends if they didn't prove successful against Number 9? So we got that Robbie Rotten beat Number 9 and made LazyTown lazy, but that also strikes up another question. Are there more numbers? Are Number 9 and Sportacus apart of a group that ride blimps and help make kids exercise and play outside? Now

are


you ready for the biggest stretch in t
his entire theory?
Robbie Rotten was the first Sportacus-like member of t
his group. Why so? Well Robbie admits it
himself.
In a little known song called "We Are Number One."

He masturbates in the shower often and whenever he
does it clogs up the drain. His cum is really t
hick and it's so fucking difficult to get rid of unless


you pick up the filter with


your hand and it smells so fucking bad. So either I a pick up the drain and have me fingers touch
his sperm or I just take a shower anyways and the water cant go
down the drain so water diluted with my brothers sperm is covering my feet. Yeah and I can't tell
him unless I want to get in an awkward af conversation about is cum and
him masturbating.
He also has huge fucking s
hits that clog the toilet and never checks if the toilet is clogged after he flushes. And even if he did, he
doesn't try to unclog with the toilet with the plunger ever so my dad has to
do it. A couple times the pipes were leaking or somet
hing because there was water dripping in the living room (w
hich is right above the bathroom) because of
his fat s
hits.

We warned the community about t
his months ago.
Creating copypasta w
hich takes advantage of our beloved /u/Cummybot2000 is not allowed.
Many of


you ignored t
his rule and from t
his point onward, any copypasta about Cummybot will result in a perma-ban.
edit: The mods have discussed and agreed - Not a perma-ban, a temp ban

The human penis is certainly among the finest in the animal king
dom. It is generally of robust, satisfying proportion, features subtle ribbing that provides sturdiness and enhanced sensation, has smooth, sliding skin w
hich reduces friction and provides excellent mouthfeel, and is visually interesting with its many veins, skin folds, and a glans with a shape that suggests sleekness and a color that changes to demonstrate the intensity of lust.
However, it is certainly not <i>the</i> best. It is firmly in t
hird place.
In first obviously comes the horse. I won't go into great detail on horse cocks, as they

are already quite popular even with the non-zoop
hilic general public. The size, the shape, and the power of the animal a horse cock is attached to

are all part of a sexual mystique that has been well explored in many cultures throughout
history.
There is one other kind of animal, however, that has us solidly beat, even though it has no such following. I speak of the spectacular, over-the-top sensuality of the amazing "red rocket" possessed by canines. We ignore t
his one, perhaps, because
dogs

are generally much closer to the majority of us than horses. There is no reason to romanticize the mundane, as we
do for the equine penis, and we

are often quite sc

ared of our
dogs' sexuality, since we
do have to live with them instead of just looking at them in a field we're driving by. By acknowledging that it's at all there, we

are forced to deal with it in a fas
hion other than having the vet remove it, and we

are usually more worried about what that means for us than what it means for them.
Nonetheless,
dog penises

are wonderful, a fact w
hich deserves to be recognized even if the vast majority of us will never experience one firsthand.
The first t
hing that anyone will notice about a
dog's erection is the color. "Florid" is the best word I can t
hink of to describe t
his beautiful display. From angry, fire engine red, through every possible shade of pink, with some extraordinary specimens additionally featuring deep purple and glistening w
hite, an erect
dog's penis rewards the viewer's eyes with the full spectrum of colors that our culture associates with the urgent desire of lust. As it comes out of its sheath, its palette seems to beg to return to a warm and cozy place inside the body of another.
Its form and functionality

are similarly titillating. The pointed, very slightly fl

ared tip allows for easy entry without being completely smooth, and w
hile perhaps not as visually exciting as the glans of a human, certainly gets the job
done comfortably and efficiently. The size when fully erect tends to be very impressive in proportion to its owner, often being much t
hicker and somewhat longer than the average human penis. However, most people

aren't fully aw

are of that, because of another handy trick the canine dick can perform.
When the action begins, it's much smaller. Very t
hin, and a bit shorter. Once it's in, or played with sufficiently, it inflates to its full, throbbing size, allowing for the receptive partner to adjust more comfortably. No inflatable dil
do I've ever seen has such a wide range of widths as
does our best friends' tackle. They usually just seem to start at "too big" and get "slightly bigger." A
dog's penis is much more friendly, allowing even the novice to enjoyably accommodate somet
hing really fat and juicy.
And juicy it certainly is! One of the best t
hings about wolf wang is the precum. There is so much! And unlike ours, w
hich merely drools when we get close to the end, theirs begins squirting almost constantly, nearly as soon as the fun begins. The result is a satisfyingly messy taste sensation that is truly without comp

are. On the other end, t
his also serves a practical purpose, contributing greatly to the fact that a
dog penis is self-lubricating, a trait I'm sure we've all wished we could sh

are at some point.
Of course, no discussion of
dog dicks would be complete without a mention of the crown jewel, the one t
hing that most strikingly sets them apart from us: the bulbus glandis. Ranging in size from a rather small plum to near that of a softball, the swollen base of a canine's cock is both an invitation and a challenge. Do


you want to take the knot? Can


you? Once


you have, of course, there is the dizzying feeling of being
dominated, not by


your partner, but by


your own desires. Trapped there on the floor for up to twenty minutes, one must simply wait and enjoy the feeling of being so consumed with lustful passion that the fear and shame of being caught seem immaterial. When


you

are tied, it is inescapable that a part of


your identity is firmly outside of the mainstream's comfort zone. A piece of


your soul is there, wrapped tightly around that
dog's twitc
hing, squirting dick just as surely as


your pussy or ass is.
The t
hing that draws many to such interests is the fact that t
his is a perfectly symbolic microcosm for all of our sexuality. In our culture, even purely vanilla sex is often made to feel "naughty." The most banal and benign aspects of sexuality

are couched in terms that make us feel a little wrong to want it, even in the strictly defined contexts where it's not supposed to be. In that moment when


you accept the knot, and make


yourself incapable of defense against whatever might occur should


your
door suddenly open,


you have decided that


you're not going to play that game anymore. The world may say


you're a filthy slut;


you're happy to be one, if that means enjoying


yourself to the fullest with


your most loyal companion.
Overall, it is simply a fact that


your
dog's dick is better than


yours in nearly every way that matters. It's alright to feel a little jealous, but I t
hink it would be nice if we as a culture could recognize t
his more openly, similarly to how we
do for horses. Happiness in t
his strange and beautiful world in w
hich we live lies in fully appreciating all of nature's marvels, and nature has certainly made the canine penis marvelous.

I'm Rick Harrison, a Capitalist scum pig, and t

Very disappointed in the new Star Wars movie. Traditionally Star Wars has been an all-American franc

are infested with ethnics: a woman Jedi, a black storm trooper, a C

are the many species of gays including a trans droid (C-3PO) and even a full blown homosexual (Kylo Ren) w

Hello team, I'd like to preface t

you guys aw

are of the fact that I am a
high IQ player. Some of the t

you, every action that I take has a greater meaning, and unless


you also have
high IQ


you'll probably not understand the "questionable" t

do not speak to me like we

you.

Haha god it's just so obvious how much


you hate


yourself eh. You're probably 14/15 right? T

you understand the world around


you. T

your opinions

are the real truth. Your future is written in everyt

you probably t
hink


you're so complicated and unique. I can read


you like a c
hildren's 5 page book. You're a not
hing. And I wish anyt
hing I could say would change that, but frankly


you're just one of the students that needs to fill the ranks at Mc
donalds. It's a hard truth but


you need to swallow it quickly. You

are not a creator,


you

are a destroyer. Someone that puts
down everyone around themselves until they form a hole where there's only room for


you. You lonely, sad fucking pit of pathetic. You will never be anyt

yourself and be better today. But


you'll never escape who


you

your life, enjoy putting people

doing somet

you will live t

Sucking dick ain't just for the gays any more, fellas. It's a very useful bartering tool that I have personally employed for the last decade. But


you're going to want to hone


your skills first before putting them into play. Practice on bananas or cucumbers to start. When


you feel comfortable, get together with some bud
dies for a suck session and critique each other until


you feel confident. Now it's time to put the dick where


your mouth is. A few months ago, I applied for a position at Jersey Mike's Subs. The manager told me I was grossly unqualified and one of the most incompetent people he's ever met. He was singing a different tune after I tickled my tonsils with the tip of
his prick. I've been making subs t
hirteen hours a week ever since. But it
doesn't end there. You can use


your dick sucking prowess to conquer many of life's little obstacles. Got pulled over for speeding? Suck that dick! Long line at the supermarket? Suck


your way to the front! Wife mad at


you for sucking so much dick? Suck hers! It's 2017, boys, and it's time to relinquish


your homophobic tendencies. Swallow


your pride, then swallow that load!

I've got aspergers. For people like me, fidget cubes, spinners, etc.

are VERY helpful to us when we're stimming. When I heard about the fidget spinner, I was pretty excited. A silent, subtle fidget toy that

you look like an ass? Sign me up!
Queue people who turn it into a trend. Now I can't get one without looking like a moron. Now people

are spinning it on their heads, putting razor blades on it, etc.
Reasonably, teachers and similar people

are now taking them away.
It pisses me off. I

I'm sorry, my man, I
do believe a minor error has been made. I am not what


you might call a "weeb". I am simply a japanese animated content matter enthusiast. I enjoy anime because it is refres
hingly different. There is quite a difference between me and a "weeb". However, I
do quite believe that


you, good sir,

are not without issues. The fact that


you spend


your days browsing anime videos simply to inform individuals such as myself that they

are "fuckin weebs" is, to be perfectly candid, quite sad. I find people like


you to be quite intriguing. Under some delusion of normality,


you tell off fans of anime for being themselves, and not being exactly like


you. It is, of course, common knowledge that well-adjusted socially gifted individuals, such as


yourself,

are devoid of all flaws, and it is therefore their right to belittle and insult anyone that is not part of the mainstream collective simply because they

are different. You sir, and men & women like


you,

are what is wrong with society. Indeed,


you
do not even deserve the title of "sir". I shall simply refer to thee as "c
hild". I have very little respect for c
hildren like


you. And that respect is only there because "respect t
hine enemy" is an important principle to live by. If, by any chance,


your un
doubtedly underdeveloped brain for some reason cannot comprehend language such as w
hich was used in t

please,
do return to


your dull, "normal" life in ignorance. Now,
do stop wasting everyone's time.

The year is 2025.
I woke up at exactly 6:00. I need no alarm clock. Two women woke me by sucking my cock.
I gave .00000001 btc to each of the women as a tip. Three women helped me into the shower,
all w
hile c

aressing me and drooling at my btc wallet. They also came instantly after
seeing my balance.
I left my 50 acre mansion and got in my gold-plated 2030 Lamborg
hini Murcielago (custom made for me after the dealer saw my btc)
and another one of my bitches was waiting in the passenger seat. She was in the car all night, because she couldn't sleep without me having penetrated her. She hopped on me and started riding my dick w
hile I squeezed her tits and drove with my knees. In a w
him, I arrived at the gym. I threw the bitch off me, and she quickly returned to the passenger seat, where she would sit until I got back.
When I got out the car, I flexed. My bulging, huge, muscles ripped my Gucci s
hirt off, and six women lined up. We had an orgy, w
hich didn't last too long. Each woman climaxed when my cock came wit
hin five inches of her pussy, and went into an eternal state of euphoria after seeing my btc wallet.
I came, and transferred .00000000001 btc to each of the women.
After benc
hing seven hundred kilograms, I squatted four hundred kilograms. I started
doing my 100 laps, but I got a phone call. It was a conference call with nineteen supermodels. They orgasmed after hearing my voice.
My bitch in the car was getting lonely, so I went back. She sucked me off as I took the drive back home. I left her in the car, transferred .000000001 btc to her, opened the diamond-encrusted knob and went inside.

So there I was c
hilling on my mobile operation center when I found t

It was clear there was somet

are aspirational creatures.

But everybody's like Cristal

The colour of Cristal is not wholly dissimilar to that of honey.

Maybach

May is the month in w
hich people

are most frequently stung by bees, and Bach's 9th Concerto is called The Flight of the Bees.

diamonds on


your timepiece

One of the many t
hings most bees will never own.

Jet planes

Jet planes can fly. JUST LIKE BEES CAN.

Islands

Bees

are found on some islands.

Tigers on a gold leash

Tigers

are the natural enemies of bees.
[NOTE: At t
his point - essentially the start of the chorus - the song stops being about bees, and switches to being from the perspective of bees, before switc
hing back for the second verse.]

We
don't c

are, we ain't caught up in


your love affair

Bees

are unable to experience love. Their lives

are given in devotion to the
hive and the Queen, and they have no time for such silly flights of fancy as romance.

And we'll never be royals, it
don't run in our blood

Worker bees will never become the Queen Bee because those

are two different bee jobs.

That kinda lux just ain't for us

Worker bees

are born to be busy, not sit around all day like the lazy Queens. 'Lux' is also a reference to Luxor, in Egypt. Some ancient Egyptian pharaohs were buried with honey that is still edible today.

We crave a different kind of buzz

They love the sound of their buzzing in the open air, not the louder, tinnier, more echo-y buzz wit
hin the
hive, where a Queen would spend most of her time. They also enjoy the "buzz" of flying, as opposed to sitting around all day on their fat Queen arses.

Let me be


your ruler

The second part of the chorus comes from the POV of the Queen, who is, of course, the ruler of the bees.




you can call me Queen Bee

The Queen Bee is the Queen Bee, w
hich is why she wants to be called Queen Bee.

and baby I'll rule

The workers

are all her babies and she will rule them.

Let me live that fantasy

She's, like, super into her job.

My friends and I, we've cracked the code

An acknowledgement of the fact that there is a code to crack. Also, bees have cracked the code of how to make honey, w
hich nobody else has managed to
do.

We count our
dollars on the train to the party

T
his is to
highlight the contrasting lifestyles of Lorde, who enjoys money, transport and good times, and bees, w
hich have no need or desire for any of those t
hings, and simply toil for the good of the
hive.

And everyone who knows us knows, that we're fine with t
his

Both Lorde and bees have accepted their roles in life.

We didn't come from money

T
his line was originally meant to be "we didn't come from honey", but some meddlesome record exec made Lorde change it. The line was originally meant to indicate that Lorde, despite accepting her lot, is still kinda jealous that she isn't a bee.
[NOTE: At t
his point the song goes back into the pre-chorus and the chorus, followed by a bridge - w
hich I will analyse below - and then a final chorus before the song ends.
T
his bridge is, once again, told from the Queen's perspective.]

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

A really bad impression of the sounds bees make.

We're bigger than we ever dreamed

The Queen cannot believe the amount of bees in her
hive. Like it's way more than she ever imagined. Also Queen Bees

are pretty big.

And I'm in love with being Queen

She freaking loves her job.

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

Lorde really
doesn't know what bees sound like.

Life is great without a c

are

Queen Bees have it easy, and
don't have to worry.

We

aren't caught up in


your love affair

But, like the workers, cannot feel romantic love. Tragic.
So, that's my analysis. I t
hink it's pretty clear at t
his point that t
his song is literally all about bees, from start to finish. Hopefully I will open a few eyes, and maybe even start a discussion about bee allegories in popular music in general - the number of songs that

are, ultimately, about bees

are simply too numerous to count, but getting the word out about t
his song is a start.

Original post: read first
And then one of the popular girls stayed back after my make-s
hift class and gave me a stellar blowjob and then we fucked b

areback and then she went home and then she texted me a month later saying she was pregnant and then eight months after that the baby was born but it had two heads and six eyes because my dick gives off radioactive waves (I checked using my Geiger counter, even though I
don't need one because I'm smart enough to teach the whole class w
hilst juggling with hyper-scenarios of quantum physics and astronomy in my brain). The baby grew up into a healthy adult without me in its life and then he met me and gave me a swift upper cut, breaking my jaw. The smartness emanated by my brain remoulded and fit my jaw back into the correct position and my radioactive dick emitted alpha waves and ionised the skin of my estranged son, killing
him upon contact. Then I met that girl again and got another blowjob and fucked and had another kid and the cycle repeated until we both finally passed away, mid-blowjob, at the age of 897 in the dystopian future where the only memes

are deep fried and surreal and my IQ was still above my age

Oh my fucking god, I t
hink I might hate Japanese t
his year. Last year we had a teacher named Ms. Noguc
hi, she was an old woman from japan, but her classes were serious and quiet. We had tests every other day. But she retired. Now we have t
his one woman who learned Japanese at PSU who makes the classroom look more like a GOD DAMN anime with kawaii posters everywhere and we also sit in FUCKING GROUPS LIKE BRAIN DEAD KINDERGARDNERS. She said she got interested in Japanese through anime and THIS LARDED FUCK STARTED TALKING OUT LOUD TO THE TEACHER ABOUT HIS FAVORITE ANIMES WHEN SHE WAS STILL INTRODUCING HERSELF. Also outside in the hallway there is a display case that used to show old japanese artifacts, NOW THERES JUST FUCKING MANGA BOOKS IN THERE AND OTHER SHIT. My god I wanted to learn japanese because it was different not to look like a FUCKING WEEB.

Straight men

are not very manly. If


you were really manly


you would not allow


your penis to be swallowed by a pussy. That is very submissive. Having sex with a pussy is the gayest act I can imagine. A real manly man would be all man all the time and only fuck and be friends with men. You would only allow


your penis to touch other penises and


your sex would look a lot like swordplay.

I sexually identify as Harambe the Lowland Gorilla. Ever since I was a boy I have dreamed of eating fruits and plants in the captivity of a zoo. People say to me that being an endangered Lowland Gorilla is impossible and I'm fucking retarded, but I
don't c

are, I'm a beautiful and strong silverback. I'm having a plastic surgeon install Gorilla arms, legs, torso, and a bulletproof vest on my body. From now on, I want


you to call me Harambe and respect my right to eat, live with, and fuck other Gorillas. If


you can't accept me


you're a Gorilla murdering Zoophobe and


you need to check


your primate privilege. Thank


you for being so understanding.

So


you want to know more about me?

i'm objectively pretty attractive. 6'1'', fit, facial aesthetics, and have a large number of friends. BUT, my little dicklet is laughable. 5 inches long, and a mere 4 inches of girth. to be honest, it hasn't seemed to matter that much with girlfriends. i am enthusiastic in the sack, can muster serious stamina, and know my way around a cunt.
YET there is not
hing more i love
doing than going to some barslut or tinder whore's place and revealing my pathetic pissclit. i'm sure they expected the whole package with me, so the look of defeat is palpable. it is an amazing sort of bathos that plunges them into a chasm that only a mind addled by hunger for BIGCOCK can appreciate.
i then fuck them poorly for a hasty 5 minutes, ac
hieve my climax, and make my leave, knowing i've
done right in t
his world.

Why the fuck
do


you guys talk to /u/CummyBot2000 as if it is a real human?
Are

When a woman gets a vibrator, it's seen as a bit of naughty fun. BUT when a guy orders a 240 volt Fuckmaster Pro 5000 blowup latex
doll with 6 speed pulsating pussy, elasticized anus with non-drip semen collection tray, together with optional built-in realistic orgasm scream 7.1 surround system, he's called a pervert.

I used to masturbate onto birds at a local park. Not a t
hing that I'm particularly proud of but I became quite good at it. I was taking zinc supplements so I was shooting massive loads and it became somet
hing of a sport to me. For anyone interested here is


your best strategy. first,


you need to find an isolated spot so


you
don't become a sex offender. I found a short kind of channel

area where I saw the pigeons would congregate. Next,


you arouse


yourself. I was usually content with envisioning the occasional jogging lady coming over and taking a s
hit on my chest and that was enough to fuel the fire but if


you're not as sexually charged as me just take some porn on the go. After


you're good an horny,


you get some bread. My pigeons preferred w
hite bread but healt
hier birds might have a taste for honey wheat or maybe even multigrain. Fat, unhealthy birds

are slower and easier to
hit so remember that. Once


you

are seated on the bench and ready to
do the deed, w
hip


your roosevelt out and scatter bread out wit
hin a few feet of


you. use


your judgement based on how far


you know


you can cum. I was a lonely and depraved soul who could
hit targets the size of a t
himble at distances up to 4 feet. You wait for the pigeons to begin eating and to get comfortable with


your presence. At t
his point,


you want to coo gently and talk sensually to them to gain their trust. Now


you're finally ready to cum on


your bird. T
his is a tough part because the rapid motion of masturbation is very frightening to the birds, so


you have to be subtle. Once


you master a technique,


you simply wind it up and let it go, aiming depending on


your past cumming experiences. I always came
high so I would aim for the neck of the bird and catch it right in the face. It's an extremely satisfying and erotic feeling, seeing those birds reel around covered in cum and maybe even transporting it to other places in the city. Either way I haven't
done it in years but every now and then I catch myself gazing wistfully at a flock of birds, cock throbbing and waiting for them to land close to me.

A few years ago I was sitting at my computer watc

down my win

door abruptly, we didn't speak for the rest of the afternoon. To t
his day I can't watch mythbusters with my family, but having the choice, I much prefer my mom t
hinking I was fapping to mythbusters than japanese bondage enemas.

Fapping to trap porn is the least gay t
hing there is. If


you fap to gay porn, that's 2 guys, and that's 100% gay. If


you fap to 'straight' porn, then that has a woman, sure, but


you're also fapping to a guy, w
hich makes it 50% gay. But a trap is like half male, half female, and thus a trap with a girl would add up to 75% girl, and thus only 25% gay. 2 women would be ideal, but that would be a lesbian relations
hip, w
hich brings it around to gay again. If


you fap to furry porn, then it's in a weird gray

area, where if it's people in fursuits, the same rules apply, but if it's with animals, I would t
hink it depends on said animal's sexuality. Then there's consent. If a person
doesn't consent to somet
hing, but the other person
does it anyway, that makes the other person stronger, and thus less gay. Let's say that means they're about 50% less gay. If it was gay rape, that means that it's now 75% gay. If it's straight rape by a man, then it's 25% gay. And, if it's trap gay porn, than that's 12.5% gay. So technically, yes, rape trap porn is the least gay porn there is, but that's still looped in with trap porn, hence why fapping to trap porn is the least gay t
hing there is.

My teacher said to my I'm a failure, that I'll never amount to anyt

you see...BAZINGA!" One line student laughs in the back, I turn to see a who t
his fellow genius is. It's none other than Stephen Hawking.

No, I meant now, Ma. Get the pie now.

Okay.
You said it,

How's that working out for

Actually, it's for all of us.

You see, if we could reroute the customers

it's gonna help the kiosks

It's

you know what we
do have?
Our voices! We have our voices.
If


you remember one t
hing
from today, it's t
his.
The mind is the only weapon
that
doesn't need a holster.
Right. Awesome.
How long
do we get for lunch?
Half hour. But I eat in 20, w
hich leaves me
five minutes for social time,
five minutes to get refocused.
We got a
high roller.
Sir, I'm gonna need


you to pull to the right.
Please pull to the side, sir. Out of traffic.
Tan jacket, red scooter,

please pull to the right, out of traffic.
Sir.
Thank


you.
Driving kind of recklessly back there, sir.
You're kidding.
I
don't joke about shopper safety.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
issue


you a citation.
Gonna need


your first and last. Last first.
Sir. Sir. Sir, sir, sir.
Please
don't make t
his more difficult
than it needs to be, okay?
Are


you able to...
Sir. Sir! Sir. I am warning


you, sir.
You're pus
hing it.
Sir. Sir. I am warning... Sir.
Sir. Sir. Sir.
Okay.
T
his is adding up, sir. He'll be back.
He'll be back. He'll be back.

Hey.
Hi. Do


you need somet
hing?

Yes. I'd like to welcome


you to our mall.
Well, thank


you.
Is there somet
hing else?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Just looking for some hair extensions.
Need a little more volume up top.
Do


you
do men?
Do


you
do men hair? Do


you
do men hair?
On the men?
Are


you the guy
that crashed into the minivan?
I
don't t
hink so. W
hich one?
Well, that one. That one right there.
Yeah. That one, yes. That...
You know, that one was me.

Oh, wow. Are


you okay?
Oh, yeah. Never better.

Although they're
docking the paycheck
pretty good.
Yeah.
You know what


you should
do?
You should get the security tape,
and then, like, sell it to one of those shows,



you know, where people crash into stuff.

Hello, early retirement.
Yeah, right?

Volume. Right, let me just see what I've got.
Yeah, t
his is Blart.
If


you need me, I'm over by the kiosks.
Who is t
his?
It's Officer Blart, reporting from Sector 5.
What the hell

are


you bothering me for?

Just a Code B check.
What a moron.

You know, I'll check in with them later.
It's pretty intense.
Oh, right, yeah. Life of a security guard.

What, what?
No, it's just that


you said security guard,

and it's perfectly acceptable...
I'm so sorry if I called


you the wrong t
hing.
No, no, no, no. You did fine,


you know?
It's just that there's a huge,
huge controversy
brewing in the industry right now,
whether the title should be
Security Guard or Officer.
I'm sure


you heard about it.

I didn't.
You will. You're gonna.
But I'm sure I will.
It's out there.

So,


you all set
for the busiest shopping day of the year?
Yeah, right.
And the worst day for a birthday.
T
his year, it falls on a Black Friday, w
hich
means I probably won't even get a card.
Everyone's too busy shopping.
You know what? Yeah. Autumn Ash.

Yeah.
I t
hink that's


your color.
I t
hink t
his'll work.
It's a winner.
So that's $9.95.
$9.95?
Yeah.
Wow.

At those prices,
now


you got me t
hinking ponytail.
All right. Thank


you.
Thank


you.

Right. So there


you go.
Okay.

And, there


you go.
Thank


you, Amy.
Thank


you, Officer Blart.
Hey, Blart. Wow, nice s
hirt.
You went with a medium?
It's a bit formfitting,
but that's 'cause we're required to wear
protective vests under our...
No. Not buying it. No.
'Cause I
don't see any vest
underneath here, so...
No, but it's a t
hick T-s
hirt.
Basically like a thermal they have


you wear.
Nope. Nope. No.
I
don't understand why


you're laug
hing.
I just called


you fat.
I'm not laug
hing.
Yeah, whatever. Amy.
Hey, everyone's going to American Joe's
tonight, and I want to see


you there.
Okay?
We're gonna split some onion strings.
Wow. Wow.
Good.
Good hang.
Wow, yeah. That's great.
Hey, Blart, they need


you
at Victoria's Secret.
Okay, roger that.
Okay, I gotta go.
Okay. Bye.

I found it first.
No,


you didn't.

La
dies. Problem.
What's the genesis?
She's trying to take
the last push-up bra in t
his size.
There's gonna be a new s
hipment tomorrow.
They'll be here by noon.
Well, I need t
his one now.
I have a date tonight.
Really? Is he blind?
Whoa!
Waterproof shoes and Baggies on the socks.
Not my first rodeo.
Okay, la
dies, need to see some ID.
No,


you
don't.
Ma'am, I should warn


you, I
do have
the authority to make a citizen's arrest.
So
does anyone.
I could arrest


you right now.

That's true. She could.
Hey, not talking to


you. Okay?

Can I see


you for a second,
please, ma'am?
Look, I understand


your sensitivity.
I've had some issues with weight myself.

Are


you calling me fat?
No. No, no, no, no.

I'm just saying I've been
down that road.
I mean... I mean, I'm still on it.
We both

are,


you know? Stranded.
Let's face it, we eat to fill a void, right?
But as soon as I started eating healt
hier,
I noticed I wasn't so moody.
And PS,


your skin's gonna clear up.

Can


you hold onto these?
Sure.

Ma'am.
You...
She's got tremen
dous upper body strength.
Backup! Backup!
She's biting my neck. She's biting my neck.
Backup!
Backup! Backup!
Look, I know


you're new here and all,
but "backup" seems like
a pretty universal term.
Hey. Can I give


you a lift?
What, on that?
With an inexperienced driver
I would recommend no,
but with me,



you'll be as safe as the President.
I
don't know. Couldn't that get


you fired?
Yes, it could.
Okay.

Is t
his all right?
Absolutely.

And here


you go. Safe and sound.

'65 Mustang.
Yeah.

Fun fact for


you, a lot of people t
hink
the Mustang was named after the horse.
It was actually named after
the P-51 Mustang.

That's a plane.
I didn't know that.

Well, thank


you for the ride, Paul.
That was so much fun.
No problem.
Listen,
if


you ever,


you know, need rides anywhere,
Dispatch, they can get me. You know.

Or we could just text each other.
Yeah.
Yeah, give me


your cell phone.
My cell?

Yeah, and I'll punch my number in.
Left it in the casuals. You know what?
Just give me


your number
and I'll remember it.

Okay. Ready?
Yep.
All right. 555...
Not yet. Just...

Now I'm ready.

555...
555...

...01...
...01...
...78.
- Eight. Got it.
That's it. It's locked.
Great, so I'll see


you tonight
at American Joe's, right?
Yeah, I mean, everybody's going, so...

Yeah.
...why not me, too? I'll be...

Yeah, I'm there.

Great. Bye.
Okay. Bye.
Hey.
Hey! Hey. Glad


you made it, Paul.

Good to be here.

Fun fact for


you...
T
his place sucks.
You want to get out of here?
No.

I'm sorry, what were


you saying?
No, I was just saying that
the first American Joe's actually opened
its
doors in 1972.
And most people,
because of its service and theme,
t
hink that it's derivative of Abe and Louie's,
but it's not.
It's its own t
hing.
You really know a lot of facts, Paul.
Hey, Blart, I heard


you got


your ass handed
to


you by a fat c
hick at Victoria's Secret.
Well, I
don't
hit women,

so I
don't even know what...
Yeah. Just minivans, right?

Hey, why
don't


you go over to the bar
and grab


yourself one of those girly drinks?

I'll meet


you over there.
Okay. Does anybody else want a drink?
'Cause Stuart's buying.
No, no, no. They're good. They're good.
So... They're good.
Okay.

Hey, listen, I...
We're basically already together, so...
I wasn't... I didn't even realize that.

And I was... I wouldn't... Doing anyt
hing.
Yeah.

I just want


you to grab a hold of it, tight.

Okay?
I got it.

I mean,
it's not like


you really had a chance, okay?
Security guard? Really.
But


you're a pen salesman, dude.
Yeah, and I just bought a Camry,
so


you can eat me.
All right, bro. Back off.
You know, we're all just here having fun.
Okay, bro.
What?
Hey, thanks
for getting my back there, brother.
Security blood runs deep between...
Yeah, let's just go.

Round six.
Let's
do t
his t
hing.
Gentlemen ready?
No.

Not yet. Now I'm ready. Okay.
And, go!
Leon, I can't give


you the Heimlich,
so


you better chew.
I know.
Told


you, boy. You better hurry up.
There


you go. Nachos in my face.
Oh, my God. These peppers.
The peppers

are hot.
Oh, my God. Oh, that's a hot pepper.
Nachos

are good, man.
Better inform all


your friends, boy.
Nachos about to be gone.
You're lagging be
hind.
Come on, Paul. Playing games.
I love these nachos, I'll tell


you that much.

That lemonade is insane.
Yeah, Paul.
That's because it's a margarita.
No. I
don't drink.

Twist it.
Feel the nub.

Hey,


you want some? Here.
Yeah.

You want fruit?
Bye! You blinked! You blinked.
Time to pluck the grape from the vine.
Still got the Baggies! Hot jiggity.
Coming on the left.
False alarm.
Told my mom everyt
hing about us.
What

are


you talking about?
You're acting coy. Come on. It's natural.
You know. You so know.
No, I'm sorry, Paul. I
don't know.
Snap. Pop goes the weasel.
So happy!
Yeah!
Yeah!
I believe in magic!
No way!
I'm sorry it didn't work out, dear.
It's fine, Ma.

Hey, Dad, why
don't we check for matches?
Yes.

Yeah, I
don't t
hink so, sweetheart.
I t
hink I'm just gonna turn in.
Well, how about somet
hing special
for lunch tomorrow to cheer


you up?
I
don't t
hink so, Ma. It's fine.
If somet
hing's gonna work,
it would be the sloppy joe.
But that would probably... You know.
You know, if


you're
doing the sloppy joe,

do the sweet potato fries.
But it... Whatever,


you know.
Well
done. Yeah.
Maya. Hey.
Dad. I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
There

are other fish in the sea.
You just gotta keep looking.
And it
doesn't matter what


you
do.
Because once someone takes the time
to get to know the real


you,
all bets

are off.
If it
doesn't work out,


you'll always have us.
I'm sorry, sweetie, I popped my ears.
I didn't hear a word


you were saying.
You just have to...
Is that a tattoo?
I... Yeah, yeah, it is.
When did


you get it?

I got it last night.
What is it?

It's the Loch Ness monster.
I
don't drink.

Hey.
Hi.

That was
a little weird the other night, huh?
Yeah,


you know, it had its moments. Yeah.
Was one of them
when I tried to make out with


your purse?
You see, alcohol instantly turns to sugar
in the blood.
And what happens is the capillaries...
Yeah, look. A lot of people...
Pretty much everybody,


you know, tends
to write me off.
And if


you did, too, believe me, I get it.
I just...
I guess what I'm asking is that


you
don't.
Okay. You know, I'm sorry, I've just...
I've gotta cash my paycheck
before the bank closes. I'm...
No problem.
Maybe we could talk later or somet
hing?

Yeah, sure. You could just text me, or...
Okay.
Yeah.
I can
do that. I can
do that.

You know, Paul, everybody texts these days.
I can't believe


you
don't have a cell phone.
I'm not about all t
his technology, Vijay.
I prefer face-to-face interaction
or a nice handwritten sentiment.
300 bucks?
I dug myself into a really deep hole
with t
his girl,


you gotta help me. Please.
Paul,


you've always been a straight shooter,
so I'll tell


you what.
Why
don't


you take my daughter
Parisa's phone?

No, I can't
do that.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

I'm punis
hing her.
No. What with all the parties
and that ex-boyfriend Pahud,
she went over her minutes.
When and if she decides to turn
her life around, I'll simply take it back.
Until then,


you use it.

Thanks.
Sure.
Stay wit
hin the minutes.
Of course.

Hey. It's too late to go in that way, guys.
It's closed.

No one's going in there.
Yeah. I t
hink we

are.

Hey, yo, Paul. Come here, man.
Look, I know


you been feeling
down,
so I got t
his for


you.
"The Devil's Crotch."
Feel the burn, baby.

Thanks, Leon.
Get back at me, man.
Loading
dock's ready.
Got it.

Yeah.
You need a pen,
don't


you?
You know what? No, I'm good.

I'll just use one of their pens.
Yeah,


you
do.

Yes. The Summit 5280 fountain.

That's stunning.
Yeah, I know.

How would


you like to sign


your name
with t
his panther?
You know what? More than anyt
hing.

Yeah, that'd be great.
Here. Yeah.

It's


yours. I insist.
Oh, hey, guys.

Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Don't


you just love Fridays?
Yeah.
Best night of the week.

Yeah.

Excuse me. Sorry.
Hey.

Paul. Paul, can


you help me out?
I need to shoot over to the bank
for a minute.
There's a few kids inside,
just finis
hing up their games.
Could


you close up the arcade for me?

Yeah, sure. No problem, Mr. Ferguson.
Okay.
You okay? You seem a little
down.
Yeah, I'm fine.

You know, video game might
cheer


you right up.
Nah, I'm on duty.
Welcome to the games!
Get set.
Go.
Foul. Foul.
Foul. Foul.
Foul. Foul.
Foul. Foul. Foul. Foul.
Game over.
We

are ready.
Let's
do t
his.
Attention shoppers.
Please make


your way to the ne

arest exits.
Unfortunately, the mall will be closing early.

Everybody out!
Everybody out!

Everybody out, now!
You, too!
Hi. Hey! Hey! You got me...
I'm at the West Orange Pavilion Mall.
Hey, yo. Hey, there's some crazy-ass people
trying to take over the mall.

I'm out of here.
Everybody on the floor!

Tell them to bring SWAT.
There may be hostages.
What

are


you
doing? Get
down.
Oh, my God.
Surprised? I know.
But here's the craziest part.
I'm the leader.
Reports

are, they're inside the bank
and they got hostages.
T
his is Sergeant Howard. I need four units
around the back to secure the perimeter.
See if we can establish visual.
Report back to me immediately.
Let's get all these civilians out of here.
See if we can gain access
into the loading
dock.

Go.
I'm on it. 94, move 'em out.

Hello?
Feeling alive?
I'm sorry?
Parisa.
She makes


you feel alive,
doesn't she?
T
his must be Pahud.
Pahud, no, I'm not with Parisa.
My name's Paul Blart.
Parisa's dad took her cell phone away,
and he lent it to me.
Do not lie to me, Paul Blart.
Do not lie to me.
You

are probably
sweating over her right now.
I'm not lying.
I mean, I am sweaty,
but I'm not sweating over anyone.
That woman is like an angelic goddess
who only brings goodness to t
his world.
Plus, she has some crazy sexy feet.
Paul, the pain of t
his breakup
is far too much for me to bear, man.
Pahud, no one can blame


you
for being upset.
I mean, the holidays

are tough enough
without adding heartbreak to the mix.
Wow. Them's some heavy words, Paul Blart.
Hey, life is heavy.
Indeed. Now,


you

are at the mall, huh?
So why
do


you not head over
to Orange Julius,
call up my friend Sameer Oh?
Tell
him


you

are now my homeboy.
He will hook


you up.
Wait a second.
How'd


you know I was at the mall?
I track Parisa's phone with GPS.
Don't


you judge me.
Closing time already.
Okay, there

are 223 stores in t
his mall.
Here is a list of the 15 that I need


you to
hit.
And 15 for


you.
Okay.
Now t
his is the key to retrieve the codes
from each store's credit-card mac
hine.
They change every day, so make sure
that


you bring me back the codes
for today, Friday.
Veck, six guys in standard formation,
just like


you said.
Perfect.
Bomb! Bomb! Bomb! Bomb!
And these little piggies went
all the way home.
Do it.
Gary usually delivers the leftovers
to the Mission.
Hey, everyone. A couple requests.
Kindly tie up the person beside


you,
keep


your mouths shut,
give up


your cell phones,
and as a general rule,
do as I say.
You
do all these t
hings...
Well,


you'll be back at home in no time.
Back to


your mediocre lives.

I
don't have one.
Amy.

I was hoping that


you and I could have
a whole Bonnie-and-Clyde t
hing going on.
You know, minus dying
in a hail of gunfire, of course.
What
do


you say?
Go to hell.
Ouch.
Hey, Stewie,


you
don't mind
that I'm
hitting on


your girlfriend,
do


you?
What? No. She's not my girlfriend.
But I specifically heard


you say
that


you two were "basically together."
No. I didn't say that we were together.
I said that she's into leather.
Have at it. If


you...
God,


you're an idiot.
Hello?
T
his is Sergeant Howard
of the West Orange Police Department.

Who am I speaking with?
Hi.

Yeah, well, so here's the deal.
As


you learned the hard way,
I have motion sensors by all the
doors,
so if


you wanna enter my mall,



you might as well bring
at least six body bags.
He's drilling the safe,
and they have eyes on us.
See if we can tap into the security cameras.
Now look, no one's gonna try
and enter the mall.
Is there anyt
hing


you need? Do


you need
any food? Do


you need any water?
Oh, man. T
his dude

doesn't deviate from the book at all.
You know, since


you're asking,
I would love a Happy Meal,



you know, but...
Make sure the toy is the sea monster,
'cause I already have the dragon.
Okay, okay, now what is it


you really want?
Silence.
Hey, I'm sorry, mall's closed,
but I can help


you find the ne

arest exit
if


you just tell me where


you parked.
Sweet mercy.
T
his is not happening,
t
his is not happening, t
his is...
Oh, God. All right, t
hink, Paul, t
hink.
Now what

are


you trained to
do?
Not
hing.
Detect, deter, observe, report.
I gotta report it. Reporting it.
Yo, we got a straggler.

It's a security guard.
What should we
do?

I
don't know. Give up, I guess.
Guys, what is wrong with


you?
We stick to the plan.
We got a 911 operator connecting us
with some guy named Paul Barth.
He says he's a security officer in the mall.
Hey. Blart? He's one of my guys.
Paul, t
his is Sergeant Howard
of West Orange Police Department.
The mall has been taken over,
and they have hostages.
I need


you to exit the building immediately.
We
don't need any wild cards
in t
his situation.
Copy that. Never been a wild card.
Unless


you consider the game of Uno wild.

Blart! Can we focus here,
please?
Yes. Yes, sir. On my way out.

Okay, okay. Come on,
don't
die. Don't
die.
Blart.
Don't pee. Don't pee.
Guys, motion detector just went off
at Door 26. Everybody on it.
Amy.
What the hell is he
doing? Come on!

Paul, come on!
Paulie, come on!
What's he
doing?
Come on, Blart!

Blart, come on!

Let's go! Move it!
Come on! Come on!
Get out of there!
Come on!

Is he crying?

I can't leave her.
Where's he going?
Blart!
Where's he going?

Blart, get back! Will


you talk to
him,
please?
Blart, t
his is Brooks. What's going on?
Sir, I took a sworn oath to protect t
his mall
and all inside it.
What oath? We
don't have an oath.
I sort of made up my own.
It's on a plaque in my room.
Listen, I t
hink


you're making a big mistake.
SWAT's on the way.
And I'm not gonna sugarcoat it,



you're untrained,


you're unarmed,
and let's face it, son,



you present a huge target.
With all due respect, sir,
I can't observe and report from the outside.
Over.
Well, Sergeant,
looks like


you got


your eyes on the inside.
Amy, Paul Blart here.
Are


you still in the mall?
Send.
Got
him.
Oh, my God. Oh, God.
T
hink. T
hink. T
hink, t
hink, t
hink,
t
hink, t
hink, t
hink, t
hink! T
hink!
Hold it together.
Heart of a warrior.
I missed lunch.
Thank


you.
T
his isn't happening, t
his is not happening.
Hey! Don't make t
his hard.
You like that?
Brooks, I took out a girl,
but the guy, he ran away.

Wow, Paul,


you got one.
Yes.

But let the record show,
I did not
hit a woman. I just...
I put all my weight on her.
Oh, Paul.
No, no, no. She's fine, she's fine.
Well, good, let's get


you out of there.
No can
do, sir.
I am gonna finish what I started.
What the heck is t
his?
Give me that.
Paul, t
his is Sergeant Howard again.
Since


you refuse to come out,
I'm gonna need


you to go into the bank
and find out
where they're holding the hostages.
With honor, sir.
Good to know.
Hey, I haven't heard back
from Donner or Vixen.
Okay. I'm calling an audible here, everyone.
And I need to get t
his mall locked
down
from the inside immediately.
Why
don't we just start wasting hostages?
That'll stop them.
Well, that's one way to go, but our hostages


are the only t
hing keeping the cops outside.
I'm Commander Kent. My team is deploying.
I need t
his location secured.

We got a three-block perimeter...
Establish a perimeter

and get all these people out of here.
Whoa, whoa, t
his is all
done already.
My men

are gonna
do it again, the right way.
Have


your guys fall back, now.
Have there been any demands?

A Happy Meal and absolute silence.
Well, let's make some noise.

I got snipers at the ready,
communications in check.
Let's tap into security now,
and let's get some visuals.
You can't.
They knocked out the video cameras.
I'll be ready to take on-scene command
in three, two, one. I'm in charge.
Brooks, I'm observing the bank now.
They got one assailant
guarding the hostages.
There she is.
My, God. You

are my angel pie.
Here come the love sweats.
Paul,


your radio's still on.
Roger that.

What's going on? Who is that?
We got a guy on the inside.

Don't tell me one of


your beat cops
is trying to be a hero.
No, he's neither. His name is Blart.
He's one of my security guards.

Wait a minute. Blart?
Yeah.
Paul Blart?
Yeah.

Are


you kidding me? We used to abuse
that loser in
high school. Give me that.
Blart.
T
his is Commander James Kent.
New Jersey SWAT.
We went to
high school together.
Remember?
I set


you on fire at the pancake festival?
Oh, yeah. Hey, Jimmy.
Go Green Hawks.
Yeah, listen. I've got 50
highly trained,
armed professionals out here.
At my command,
we

are retaking t
his location,
and there's no way I'm compromising
t
his mission so that some mall monitor
who used to eat lunch
with
his imaginary friend can screw it up.
Sorry, Jimmy, I had the button pressed.
All I heard was "lunch" and "friend."
Could


you
do me a favor
and put C
hief Brooks back on?
Listen to me, Blart,



you

are no longer communicating
with C
hief Brooks. Is that clear?
Hello?
Hello?
Yeah? Oh, hey, Paul, how


you
doing?
Well, it looks like they moved the hostages
into the teller

area.
I'm gonna get a closer look.
Veck.
There he is!

Everyone in the back room, now!
Come on, move, move!

Let's get in the back, huh?
Brooks. I lost visual on the hostages.
I couldn't get them out.
But I know who the leader is. It's Veck.
Veck? The trainee?

No. The brainee.
I
don't believe t
his.

I'll pass it on to Howard.
Oh, God.
Trapped is fine by me.
Commence tanning. Three, two, one.
Yeah!
Yes!
Time for some big-game hunting.
Open, open, open! Thank God.
Oh, no.
Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! We get it!
Get
him! Get
him! Get
him!
You better run.

Ru
dolph, where

are


you?
I'm about to end t
his.

Amy, huh? What a coincidence.
We got a cute little redhead

down at the bank named Amy.

Strawberry blonde, actually.
Yeah?

Well, I guess I know who I'm killing first.

Catch


you later!
Yeah?

Well, it looks like


you just ran out of mall.
It'll be over quick. She won't feel a t
hing.
You

aren't gonna touch her,
but


you

are gonna feel t
his.
Nobody wins with a head butt.

Give me


your cell phone.
I
don't have one.

What

are


you talking about?
Every kid has a cell phone.
I prefer handwritten sentiments.
Who

are these sloppy joes for?
And who gave


you t
his?
They're mine.
I'm late for my s
hift at Foot Locker.
We're getting the leader on the horn.
He wants to talk to


you.
Silence, my ass.
What's the matter?
Throw a few jabs


your way,



you curl up in a corner, suck


your thumb?
If


you
don't go toe-to-toe
with that scumbag,
he's gonna roll over on


you all night long.
It's all right. That's not my style.
Well, just in case, I wrote
down
a couple of clever comebacks, like...
Here.
T
his is what


you been
doing?
"Yeah,


you and what army?"

What's wrong with that?
He has an army.

Everyone deserves a card on their birthday.
So when


you and Ru
dolph
were laug
hing it up back at the crib
about how easy all t
his was gonna be,
were


you guys like,
"Man, any brain-dead mall cop
that gets in the way is gonna get smoked"?
And then... And then what?
You guys all
high-fived?

Veck, t
his guard is...
Winning! I know t
his, because I am all set!

But sadly, no codes!
And I'd say, considering
all the luxury items that I have stacked up
in my Amazon shopping cart,
situation unacceptable!
No, no, no, no, no, no. He looking.
Give me a gun.
Put it
down. Put it
down.
What

are


you nodding about?
I was just wondering,
were


you serious about that Happy Meal?
It isn't coming, is it?
What?
T
his is Commander James Kent,
New Jersey SWAT.
You wanted to speak to me?
I just wanna make sure
that no one
does anyt
hing stupid.
You should know my men

are deployed
and ready to bring t
his t
hing to a resolution.
The easy way or the hard way.
That is such a tough call, but...
Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and go with C,
none of the above!
I'm Amy, by the way.

Amy? From unbeWEAVEable?
Yeah.

I'm Maya.
My father talked forever about


you.
And I gotta say, he really
does like


you.
I'm gonna throw up.
Oh, that's not so bad.
Oh, my God.
They've got
his daughter.

Dad?
Maya.
Everyt
hing's gonna be okay.
How's


your blood sugar?

Don't worry about me, okay?
I'm worried about


you.
I love


you.
All right, now, I'm gonna get


you all out.
You just hang in there, okay, sweetie?
I will. I'm a Blart, remember?
Yeah. I'll see


you soon.
I'm supposed to be on my way
to the Cayman Islands with the hostages.
And where the hell is Ru
dolph?
He should be back by now.
"If Veck gets the codes,
he's taking us to Cayman Islands"?
Well, Veck Sims, welcome to the show.
Come and get me, Veck.
I got


your codes
for the credit-card mac
hines.

Yo,


you hear that? That's Paul, baby!
Blart?

That's who's been screwing all t
his up?
You have got to be kidding me.
Give me a radio.
Let me tell


you somet
hing.
You take hostages in my mall,



you

are making a big mistake.
You seriously undermissed...
And


you seriously...
Oh, no!
Blart?
Sugar. Sugar.
Blart? You there, Blart?
Hello, Blart. You there?
Hey, Blart!
I was hoping we could get an ETA
of when


you're gonna give up.
How about now?
I'll meet


you on the corner of Ne and Ver.
Yeah,


you heard me. Never!
All right, Dad.
Hey, fellas! You looking for me?
Come on. Come on, come on. Come on.
Follow me.
There he is.
We got
him trapped in Rainforest Cafe.
Great. Wait for me.
You know, my mom always said,
"If


you want somet
hing
done right,
waste the guy


yourself."
I'm paraphrasing, of course. You stay here.
Prancer, take the back.
Hey,


you. Scuba Dooby-Doo.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Can I have my codes now,
please?
Why? No codes, no Cayman Islands?
Looks like Paul Blart turned into
quite the badass.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Relax.
No.
One t
hing I know is
Paul Blart is not a badass.
Comet! Don't come back till he's dead!
Brooks. Only one more left.
Then it's just me and Veck.
Okay, who's talking to Blart?
Was it


you, sugar mouth?
All right. Let's try t
his again.
Wait! No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no!
It's her phone, it's hers.
She's talking to
him.
She's talking to
him, and I told her not to.
And it's under her leg.
The phone. Her right leg. Right there.
That's good.
Okay.
That was close.
He is a pro.
Listen, Blart, time's up. We're busting in.
Wait! Look, Veck's after
the credit-card codes, and I got them.
Just give me a few minutes.
No problem.
Isn't that cute?

Hey, Amy. I'm on my way.
Oh, hey, Blart.

Wow. Our boy Stuart just turned me on
to


your profile
on lonelyloser.com.
"Likes morning rain, walks on the beach."
Who

are


you, Olivia Newton-John?
I was just speaking from the heart.
Yeah, well, I didn't have to go online, Paul,
to know that


you love peanut brittle.
You're so pathetic.
Trippy.
T
his I can use.
What
do


you want, Veck?
I just want the $30 million
that I came here for.
But,


you know, I would settle offing



your dream girl, or maybe


your daughter.
You touch them, I
swear I'll end


you.
What're


you gonna
do, Paul?
You gonna pull up with


your left
hip forward
giving the illusion that


you have a gun,
w
hich


you and I both know


you
don't?

I could.
You're not gonna
do squat.

The next time I see


you, Paul,
I'm gonna put a bullet in


your head.
I
don't t
hink so. I'm taking


you
down.
Blart!
Oh, Blart.
Sweet mercy.
I wish I had a bat. I would bust


you open,
see how much candy fell out.

Too tight!
T
his is not happening.
It's not happening.
Come on.

Bravo. That was awesome.
And


you were just so close
to making it, too, Paul. Just so close.

It's not over yet.
Yeah, I t
hink it is.

Now the only t
hing I need

are my codes,
w
hich, judging from


your text messages,



you have been so sweet as to enter them
into


your phone just for me.
You t
hink I'm gonna carry the phone
with me that actually contains the...

Yello?
Peanut Blart and Jelly.

What's up, man?
So good to hear


your voice.
Yeah, it's good to hear



your voice, too, Pahud.
Listen, I'm gonna have to call


you back.

What? When?
I
don't know when. I'll talk to


you later.

Okay, Paul, call me back!
Call me back, Paul!
I mean,
t
his just keeps getting better and better.
I mean,


you

are impossible
to underestimate.
I mean,


you can't pass the trooper exam,



you black out if


you
don't have
a Snickers bar like every 20 minutes,



you had the chance to be the MVP,
and


you blew it.
Again, like


you always
do.
Ain't that right, Maya?
What
do


you want me to say, Veck?
You're smarter than me.
You're good on computers,



you kept


your weight under control.
I mean, people,
they look at me and


you, and...
Yeah, it's a landslide.
It's no contest.
Sorry.
Right now,


you're the man with the gun.
So here


you go.
Come on!
Go get
him!
Go, Dad.
What...
Probably should have capitalized on that.
Dad!
Lock and load, boys. We're going in.
Hey, we're on the move.
Let's go.
Come on, come on, come on.
Paul. T
hink, Paul. T
hink!
Let's go, men. Take it
down.
Secure the suspects.
Get
down!
Hold


your fire! Hold


your fire!
Down. The other one. That's the back one.
No, no. That's the same one. No!
The other one!
Veck got away with my daughter and Amy.
Entry team, clear the mall. We'll pursue.
Light.
Open the
door.
Let's
do t
his.
Jimmy, give me


your cell phone.
Gotta hand it to


you, Blart.
You're really taking c

are of business.
What up?
Pahud,
do


you still have GPS
on Parisa's cell phone?
You know I
do, Paul. You know I
do.
What can I
do for


you?
I need to know where it's headed.
Paul, it looks like
they're on their way to McGuire Airfield.
I know where that is. Thanks.
Hang on.
My God. There they

are.
Jimmy, take the wheel.
What?
Here we go! Here we go!
That was me. I can't...
Here I go! No!
Blart!
Don't
do it! Blart!
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Maya! Maya, get inside.

Oh, God!
Dad!

Paul?
I really
don't drink.
Come on. Oh, yeah?

Dad!
Come on.

Dad!
Man, that hypoglycemia is a killer.
I told


you I'd take


you
down.
Blart!
Very impressive,
taking
down an assailant without a gun.
I hope


you
don't mind if I use one.
What?

Oh, no.
Oh, yeah.

I guess
it's off to the Cayman Islands then, huh?
Soon as I get my money.
Yeah, well,


you'll be needing t
his.
Just give it to
him, Dad.
Oh, I will. Suck on that!
Okay. Situation update?
We have seven assailants in custody, sir.

Great. Nobody talks to them but me.
Yes, sir.

You see, jackass? I
don't need the phone.
'Cause I got all the access codes
written on their arm.
Now, I kill


you three,
there'll be no witnesses.
And since everybody t
hinks
t
his was a bank...
I got a newsflash for


you.
Your flight's been canceled.
That's better than anyt
hing I got.
You did good, Dad.
Yeah, I am pretty great.
You know, she
doesn't need a green card.
I
don't know what to say.
I have somet
hing I want to say to


you.
Happy birthday, Amy.
I heard


you applied to be a state trooper.
You say the word,
my department would be proud to have


you.
Thank


you, sir. But I t
hink
I'm gonna stick with what I
do best.
It's protecting the people
of the West Orange Pavilion Mall.

Let's
do some math. There

are 9,211 words in the bee movie script. The word "Bee" is said throughout the movie 173 times. 173 x 9,211 is 1,593,503 So if the original script has 9,211 words, minus out the bee there will be 8,938 words Adding 1,593,503 to 8,938,


you will get 1,602,441 words in


your requested script If


you read 4 words per second, it would take one 4.6 days to read it all without stopping.

ALL credit goes to /u/Tocinos, I just copypasta'd.
Sorry D:

When I was a boy I would lay naked outside and cover myself in sugar letting all the ants crawl over me. There was not
hing I loved more than being in the grass feeling their legs on my skin wis
hing I could one day be small enough to join their colony. Every now and then I would feel adventurous and lay with the larger ants, the ones that could bite. The following days my body would ache but I knew they were just being friendly and it was all love. Although it has been a few years since I last visited those ants I still yearn for their touch and have found other ways to deal with my urges. In another life I will be reunited with them and we shall live together and I will be truly happy.

high-tailin' towards 'yer IP so


you better prep

you call livin'. Youre fucking buzzard food, pard'ner. I reckon to be anywhere, anytime, and I can lay


you out in over seven hunn'ed ways, and thats just with my Arkansas Toothpick. Not only am I experienced in dueling, but I have access to all the big irons the Texas Rangers could afford, and I will use it to its full extent to wipe


your knee
high to a lamb ass off the face of the Mississippi,


you little saphead. If only


you could have reckoned what unholy retribution


your quip was about to bring
down yonder, maybe y'all would have stalled 'yer mug. But


you couldnt,


you didnt, and now


youre paying the price,


you gaw'durn varmint. I will stomp fury all over y'all and


you will lie belly-up in it. Youre fucking buzzard food, pard'ner.

Why the fuck

Are

I

Do british people actually exist?
I mean, they must be a meme, there is a not a single t
hing about them. And I mean it. Let's go through the evidence:

Where

are they from?

Not a single country in the world is named Britain. Some people say they come from England, and England is inside Britain, but if that was the case they would be British they would be Englanders.
Also, heard some silly theories about them coming from whales. Guys, no, whale people
do not exist. Whales live in the sea.
Do there is a consensus on british people coming from Europe, but then we

are left with a whole continent of possible locations. That's as good as not
hing.

What
do they eat?

Every country has at least one main dish. Even the US has their burgers. But these british people, what
do they eat? Heard some people associating them with tea, but everyone knows that's an Asian t
hing. Shouldn't they come from Europe? One of these two points must be wrong them. To me, it looks too sketchy.

What language
do they speak?

I challenge


you, putting all my money and my ass on the line here, to find a supposed ""british"" person speaking their native language. Most of then just speak a broken ENGLISH. Yes, english. Really suspicious, huh?
And I even tried to look deeper into it. Maybe british just SOUND like english, just like spanish could sound like portuguese for a non-speaker. So I looked up "british dictionary on google" and what I found was shocking: every word in there was AMERICAN. I kid


you not.
What t
his could mean is beyond my capabilities, but I can safely assure


you that british people
do not exist.

I sexually Identify as a dying sexually identification copypasta. Ever since everyone overused the sexually identification copypasta I dreamed of waiting for the time for it to stop being overused in order to spam other users with my unfunny wall of text. People say to me that a person who
does t
his is a laughable idiot and I'm fucking retarded but I
don't c

are, I'm beautiful. I'm having these words glued all over my body. From now on I want people to refer to me as a dying sexually identification copypasta as my preferred pronouns and respect my right to paste unfunny sexually identification copypastas to reddit in hope of receiving virtual internet points. If


you can't accept me


you're funny and mentally stable and need to check

Chess is a crappy tactical turn based RPG developed by a bunch of monkeys.
Right away


you'll notice Chess has no storyline. Instead, all


you notice is the the W
hite army and the Black army

are fighting each other over a battlefield. Note the "a battlefield," because Chess only has one story map.
As for the actual combat, it's extremely dull. Each unit can kill another with only one
hit. T
his means units with a real good movement ability
dominate the field (more on that bellow). There

aren't even any combat animations or anyt
hing that happens in combat. One unit moves on it's space and "captures" it, and the piece is removed from the game with no form of action or special effects.
Yawn.
Chess has s
hitty class balance. The Queen is flat out overpowered w
hile


your actual front line units, the Pawns. can't
do s
hit. I t
hink the developers were afraid that no one would use the female character so they buffed up her abilities really
high but now theres no point in using any other unit.
The rest of the units suck. Rooks can only move in 4 directions, same with Bishops. Boring. Also, whats up with the Knight? It has the most bizz

are combat abilities of all the units. They're retardly hard to use cause they jump around like retards to move and attack. The devs should have named t
his unit Ninja, since Knights didn't jump around like that in real life.
Worst part, is the king. You see, the devs decided that if


your king gets captured,


you instantly lose the game. W-T-F? T
his wouldn't be a problem, except that he can't move for crap. Seriously, the most important unit in the game can only move 1 space a turn? Good luck keeping
him alive w
hile every other unit in the game dances around
him.
Unbalanced classes, lackluster gameplay, and not to mention repetitive 1 hour+ games. Chess is not worth the time or


your money. Buy Final Fantasy Tactics or Disgaea instead.

Peach is the reason I work out. I have t
his fantasy where we start talking at Mushroom Castle. We exchange a few pleasantries. She asks what I
do. I say I loved her cake. She laughs. I get my drink.
"Well, see ya," I say and walk away. I've got her attention now. How many guys voluntarily leave a conversation with Princess Peach? She touches her neck as she watches me leave.
Later, as the night's dragged on and the coterie of drunk Toads grows increasingly loose, she finds me on the balcony, my bowtie un
done, smoking a cig

arette.
"Got a sp

are?" she asks.
"What's in it for me?" I say as I hand her one of my little w
hite la
dies. She smiles.
"Conversation with me, duh."
I laugh.
"What's so funny?" she protests.
"Not
hing, not
hing... It's just...
don't


you grow tired of the kidnappings?"
"You get used to it," she says, lighting her cig

arette and handing me back the lighter.
"What would


you
do if


you weren't a princess?" I ask.
"Teac
hing, I t
hink."
"And if I was


your student, what would I be learning?"
"Discipline," she says quickly, looking up into my eyes, before changing the subject. "Where

are


you from?"
"Sand King
dom," I say.
"Oh wow. That's lovely."
"It's ok," I admit. "Not everyt
hing is to my liking."
"What could possibly be not to


your liking in Sand King
dom?" she inquires.
"I
don't like sand," I tell her. "It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere."

I sexually Identify as wanting to
die. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of making a noose and stand large enough to end my sad life. People say to me that a person wanting to
die is Impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I
don't c

are, I'm dead inside. I'm having a surgeon install AIDS, 30 types of cancer and failing organs into me. From now on I want


you guys to call me "dead" and respect my right to
die at anytime and commit suicide. If


you can't accept me


you're a necrophobe and need to check


your living privilege. Thank


you for being so understanding.

Uh, I t
hink


you'll find that was the Mii Channel and not Wii Sports. Whereas t
his post clearly states right here http://i.imgur.com/AHeI6ey.png that it sounds like the Wii Sports theme w
hich


you can find HERE and not the Mii Channel theme w
hich sounds like THIS. I'd like to t
hink anyone with half a brain could tell the difference.
And I
don't expect anyone who
doesn't know what the Wii Sports theme sounds like to be able to click a URL to take them to YouTube in order to listen so


you just need to click big word that says "HERE" like so. If


you have any issues getting off the next junction on the information super
highway then shoot me a PM. But
please
don't mix up


your Wii music, and I
don't mean the GAME. But I guess I wouldn't expect someone like


you to have the taste in games to know what Wii Music actually is.
I mean, Jesus Christ sometimes I feel like I'm walking into a dementia filled old people's home.

I was on my regular thot patrol last night.
So I saw t
his bright light.
I said
"That must be a thot's party"
So I went to check on it
There was only one thotless man standing there
My nigga
Jesus Christ
He came
down to me
He said
"My son"
"You have been thotless all


your life"
"I shall give


you t
his knowledge"
He said to me
"If she breath, she a thot"
And I live by those words

wow congrats dude, really, that's very cool. i just told everyone in my family about it, everybody t
hinks that's very impressive and asked me to congratulate


you. they want to speak to


you in person, if possible, to give


you their regards. they also said they will tell our distant relatives in christmas supper and in NYE they will ignite fireworks that spell


your name. i also told about t
his enormous deed to closer relatives, they had the same reaction. they asked for


your address so they can send congratulatory cards and messages. my friends didn't believe me when i told them i knew the author of t
his gigantic feat, really, they were dumbstruck, they said they will make


your name echo through years and years to come. when my neighbour found out about what


you did, he was completely dumbstruck too, he wanted to know who


you

are and he asked (if


you have the time, of course) if


you could stop by to receive gifts, congratulations and handshakes. with the spreading of the news, a powerful businessman of the

area decided to
hire


you as the CEO of
his company because of t
his tremen
dous feat and at the same time an important international sh

areholder wants to sponsor


you to give speeches and teach everybody how to
do as


you did so the world becomes a better place.


you have become famous not only here but also everywhere, everybody knows who


you

are. the news spread really fast and mayors of all cities

are setting up porticos, ballons, colossal boom speakers, anyt
hing that can make


your name stand out more and see w
hich city can congratulate


you the hardest for t
his magnificent feat. here in my city, all the streets will be renamed after


you beginning at the next mayoral term. a lot of countries that frowned upon ours, now, thanks to


your deed, see us as a role model, a new hope. the lucky people who know about


you say "hey, that guy is my compatriot!" and everybody shouts immediately after them "YES, YES, YES!


yours is a good country". thanks to that, tourism has exploded, everybody came here thanks to


you, the inflow of international currency was huge, making our stockmarket take off and making our country the pillar for the solution of internation economic crisis. thanks to that, we

are seen as role models, and we have surpassed the US and become the richest and most powerful nation in the world. all the logging companies were very moved by


your deed and collectively decided to stop deforesting the tropical rainforests so the human race can thrive in t
his planet more and more. the worldwide chaos due to the election of
donald trump in the usa has ceased due to the fact that they

are no longer the most powerful nation in the world. the Pope has sent
his preachers all over the world to speak of


your name and


your deeds so


you work is known by every creature that walks on the surface of t
his planet. also, because of


you, the scientists at CERN have decided to stop experimenting with the large hadron collider, since the origins of the universe
don't matter anymore comparing to the magnitude of


your feat. the Mayans came back from the Andromeda galaxy and said


you were the reason they decided to let us live beyond the year 2012.


your feat was so incredible it ejected the alpha celestial body that was inhabiting the earth's orbit and threatening to destroy it. because of


you, Akira Toryama decided to continue the dragon ball sagas, t
his time with a character in


your honor.  every  tv show host, at the end of their show, now sends greetings to the whole country and one specially to


you. keep on alway being t
his wonderful, hard working, beautiful, inspiring, manificent, good spirited, creative etc. person and always keep on
doing stuff life t
his. Kept it up dude, and the world will be more and more a better place to live.

As a brony, now I understand how the Jews felt during the Holocaust, and how negroes during slavery. T
his violent persecution of the Brony lifestyle in unacceptable and needs to be brought to attention of the United Nation's Human Rights Council.

I'm a slave master, and t
his is my plantation. I work here with my niggers and my slave driver, Big Nigg. Everyone in here has chains and a collar. One t
hing I've learned after 21 years -


you never know w
hich nigger will try to escape.

My dad
died in a car crash recently. I hacked into
his computer looking for photos etc and found out he was cheating on my mom, exchanging masturbation videos and endlessly chatting and
doing cybersex with some woman in Denmark. There was even what looked like strong evidence of plans to take a trip there.
I got rid of all the evidence. Nobody else in my family knows. He took it to
his grave and so will I.
I talked to the woman via
his skype account to tell her he was dead. She asked if I'd send some of the videos of
him that she hadn't saved, that he would send almost every morning of
him walking into work telling her he loved her. I told her they had been deleted. She said I shouldn't have
done that without t
hinking of how she would feel at the news.
If my mom and brother ever found out, he would probably
dox her, go to Denmark and kill her.
But he won't, because I'm taking it to my grave.

Seriously? After 20 minutes of getting to choke t
his gorgeous girl with


your cock, two little poots of cum is all


you could manage? Pathetic. I registered and account just so I could comment in hopes that I  can make


you see how selfish


you

are. Fronting like some alpha-male w
hile Elizabeth is performing her heart out, and what
do


you give her? Two little twiddlywinks of cum? Pathetic. I've never felt more personally offended by porn before. You're a real asshole, pal.

iDubbbzTV is my favorite LGBT YouTuber, and is a true activist for LGBTQ+ rights in America. Our racist, homophobic, w
hite-supremacist, republican, judaphobic, xenophobic president, known as "Donald J. Drumpf" t
hinks he can kill all LGBT people, but not when we have amazing activists like iDubbbz standing up for LGBT community members! Just
his bravery is amazing, the way he was not afraid to say that he's truly "gay!" when
his friend told
him to jump
down and say some gay s
hit. People still t
hink Trump was the winner of the election, HOW UNTRUE! The real meme queen of the election was Hillary Clinton, a true LGBT-rights supporter like iDubbbz! Pepe is a w
hite supremacy meme, iDubbbz saying "I'm gay!" is a true act of LGBTQ+ rights activism in an amazing, well-thought-out meme.

I was in science class when a call came into our sub, I won't forget the look on her face when she looked up and told us that club panguin was gone. After that everyone started talking about it and those who knew those who were still online frantically checked there phones to see if anyones peinguin made it out alive. I personally
do not know anyone who was on the server when it shut
down but I feel sorry for those who
do.

One time my mother called me a son of a bitch, so I
hit her because no one talks trash about my mother, then I
hit myself because no one
hits my mother, she then
hit me because no one
hits her son and then
hit herself because no one
hits me, so I
hit her because no one
hits my mother. cant stop me

Basically like in t
his video:  https://www.


youtube.com/watch?v=3EEQgq0HM_k

Math class. Back in
high school, I had t
his insane crush on one of my math teachers.
Every time I had her for class, I was never able to focus on the work. I had a raging hard-on for 40 minutes straight. It ached like hell, but given the respect I had for her, I tried to
hide it as much as possible.
One day, however, was worse than usual. My dick was twitc
hing so much it felt like it was going to explode. Slowly but surely, I pulled my zipper
down and took out my cock. Pre-cum dribbled like a leaky faucet onto the tile floor; I moved my hand up and
down the shaft. I imagined Ms. Averty's moist lips wrapped around my cock. Fucking ecstasy. And then, I-
"Are


you fucking jacking off?"
S
hit. Someone noticed. I spun my entire body around, meat-stick still in hand, and unleashed my creamy load right into t
his nerd's agape mouth. He screamed and gagged in disgust, coug
hing up semen in warm, steaming chunks. But that only made me harder.
I ram my swollen fuck-stick into
his virginial asshole. It isn't Ms. Averty, but it'll
do. Blood and darkened brown fluid, probably diarrhea, oozed
down the shaft of my member. With each thrust of my midsection, I slammed my fist into
his face, the knuckles cut from
his t
hick-rimmed glasses. I felt another climax approac
hing, gave one final triumphant thrust into
his slophole, and busted the largest nut of my life into
his slumped, lifeless corpse.
And then I realized what I had
done.
When I told my mother what happened, her eyes glossed over and st

ared over my shoulder. She couldn't even bear to look at me. A few phone calls later, and I was off the hook. I've only met my dad a few times, but he must be in an extreme state of power if I could get out of a situation like that so easily.
She told me that I was moving
down south for aw
hile. I pleaded with her to let me stay, but she had already made up her mind. I couldn't believe it. I got in one little fight and my mom got sc

ared. She said, "You're moving with


your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air."

I sexually Identify as a Hit Disney Chanel Original Movie. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of having a beautiful, w
hitewashed cast with one black guy and one Asian. People say to me that being both a Disney Channel Original Movie and a "
hit" is Impossible and I'm stupid but I
don't c

are, I'm beautiful. I'm having a plastic surgeon install crappy writing and the same four chords on my body. From now on I want


you guys to call me DCOM and respect my right to make the same movie over and over again. If


you can't accept me


you're a disneyphobe and need to check


your cinimatic privilege. Thank


you for being so understanding.

do


you t
hink if Linguini sleeps in underwear, he lets Remy inside the underwear and sleeps on
his crotch, using
his weewee as a teddy bear
or even better if they're feeling adventurous
Linguini lets Remy crawl into
his asshole and lets

As a 24 year old single female I t
hink it's very hard to find a guy who's actually interested in free softw

are.
I've had guys jokingly ask to "Netflix and C
hill" but when I tell
him that I
don't use Netflix since Netflix requires proprietary softw

are to stream content,
they stop talking to me. And worse if they
do stay they t
hink I'm weird since I blocked Google IP's in my host file and we can't even watch YouTube.
I can't text them either. Once I get their numbers since I've added custom roms to my phone and refuse to use sms since it's a security concern
I require all of my friends to
download a free and open source messaging app and I sh

are with them my public PGP key so that we can verify our conversations


are secure. None of my friends

are willing to
do t
his. And I can't use sites like tinder since it's not proprietary softw

are but a major privacy vulnerability.
How come it is so hard to find a guy concerned about softw

are free
dom? I feel like I'm going to be single forever.

Copied and pasted in all its glory. T
his guy was 1000% serious.
Uh huh. Keep telling


yourself that. Keep talking s
hit about people


you
don't know on the internet. It's a nice safe t
hing to
do. No one will beat the fuck out of


you on the internet for running


your fucking mouth. That's why


you retreat here to
do it.
For the record, I'm not a homophobe. I
don't have any problem with a person's sexual preferences and my dick is just fine. It gets me off every single time (I actually have a very satisfying monogamous sex life with a beautiful woman who also has no problem getting off, but just to make sure I am satisfying her I
don't let myself come until she has several times). Truth be told if I had the option I may add a little girth to it if I could but I
don't t
hink it's necessary and I certainly
don't lose sleep over it.
The question is what the fuck is wrong with a bitch like


you that


you come on to a social media sight and throw insults at large blocks of people and then act enraged when someone slings an offhand insult back at


you? Fuck off man. Start going out in public and making


your insults to people's faces. Pathetic motherfucker

what the fuck is the point in correcting me. You t
hink I
don't know how to spell "


your"? I shortened it to "ur" because I was eating c
hips and typing one handed and didn't want to bother with those 2 extra letters just to
please a fucking lifeless fat neckbeard like


you.
Stop t
hinking


you're smart just because


you can correct somebody's spelling,


you seem like a total fucking idiot jackass and I'm ashamed and disappointed that on the internet where there

are millions of comments and commentors, I was still stuck with a response written by somebody like


you.
You obviously knew what I meant, it's not like I spelt "


your" as "s;ldkfjs;dlfkj". Take


your fucking dil
do keyboard out


your crusty ass and realize that maybe


you have no friends and plans tonight because


you're an unlikeable cumstain who repels everybody away like opposite poles on a magnet.
The next time


you comment like a fucking moron, ask


yourself "would I rather write t
his useless comment or would I rather clean my fucking act up and stop being a little s
hitter". My New Years resolution is to never have the misfortune of


you coming across any more of my comments and throwing up


your s
hitty insight at me.

Infinite poop. You sit on the toilet to poop, but the poop never stops coming out of


your butt. You have to start flus
hing the toilet every two minutes to keep up. You try to pinch


your butt closed but that makes


your insides hurt. The poop accelerates. You call 911. The paramedics call for
doctors. The
doctors call for specialists. The story trends on Twitter. You turn
down talk show appearances. Your septic tank fails. People form a cult. Your toilet is finished. Volunteers arrive with buckets and shovels. You

are completely used to the smell. The poop accelerates. You

are moved to a stepladder with a hole in the top step. The poop accelerates. The shovelers aban
don the buckets and shovel directly out the win
dow. The poop accelerates. A candlelight vigil forms around


your house. One of the workers falls over and can't free
himself. The poop accelerates. A priest knocks over the stepladder and tackles


you out the win
dow. You land in the pile. The poop accelerates. The force now propels


you forward and upward. Vigil goers grab at


your legs. The poop ignites from their candles. The Facebook live event
hits 1 million viewers. The poop accelerates. You

are 30 feet in the air. The fire engulfs the vigil and


your house. 60 feet. The poop accelerates. The torrent underneath


you is deafening. 5 million Facebook live viewers. You try to close up shop but


your butthole disintegrated long ago. 120 feet up. Your house explodes. The poop accelerates. 1000 feet. You

are now tracked on radar. You try to change


your angle of ascent but


you should have thought of that way earlier. The poop accelerates. 4,000 feet. NORAD upgrades to DEFCON 3. Concentric circles of fire engulf


your city. The poop accelerates. You have broken the sound barrier. 30,000 feet. You no longer take in enough oxygen to sustain consciousness. 60,000 feet. CNN is reporting on all the world records


you've broken. 200,000 feet. You

are no longer alive. The poop accelerates. Your body disintegrates but


your poop contrail remains. NASA can no longer track


you. You break the light-speed barrier and we can no longer bear witness. The poop accelerates. Forever.

Heh... not bad, kid. Not bad at all. Your meme, I mean. It's not bad. A good first attempt. It's plenty dank... I can tell it's got some thought be
hind it... lots of quotable material... But memeing isn't all suns
hine and rainbows, kid. You're skilled... that much I can tell. But
do


you have what it takes to be a Memester? To join those esteemed meme ranks? To call


yourself a member of the Ruseman's Corps? Memeing takes talent, that much is true. But more than that it takes heart. The world-class Memesters - I mean the big guys, like Johnny Hammersticks and Billy Kuahana - they're out there day and night, burning the midnight meme-oil, working tirelessly to craft that next big meme. And


you know what, kid? 99 times out of a hundred, that new meme fails. Someone dismisses it as bait, or says it's "tryhard," or ignores it as they copy/paste the latest s
hitpost copypasta dreamt up by those sorry excuses for cut-rate memers over at reddit. The Meme Game is rough, kid, and I
don't just mean the one


you just lost :). It's a rough business, and for every artisan meme


you craft in


your meme bakery, some cocksucker at 9gag has a picture of a duck or some s

See


you on the boards...

A man gets on a bus, and ends up sitting next to a very attractive nun. Enamored with her, he asks if he can have sex with her. Naturally, she says no, and gets off the bus. The man goes to the bus driver and asks
him if he knows of a way for
him to have sex with the nun. "Well," says the bus driver, "every night at 8 o'clock, she goes to the cemetery to pray. If


you dress up as God, I'm sure


you could convince her to have sex with


you." The man decides to try it, and dresses up in
his best God costume. At eight, he sees the nun and appears before her. "Oh, God!" she exclaims. "Take me with


you!" The man tells the nun that she must first have sex with
him to prove her loyalty. The nun says yes, but tells
him she prefers anal sex. Before


you know it, they're getting
down to it, having nasty, grunty, loud sex. After it's over, the man pulls off
his God disguise. "Ha, ha! I'm the man from the bus!" "Ha, ha!" says the nun, removing her costume. "I'm the bus driver!"

Alright, as we all know u/Cummybot2000 has gone missing. We all miss Cummy very much, but where did they go?
I believe I have some answers, friends. T
his was the last post Cummy had ever commented on. As


you can see it's a Pro-Trump pasta. I believe there's some sort of Anti-Trump conspiracy at work here. But there's more.
Roughly around the same time that u/Cummybot2000 disappe

ared the prodigal son
himself, u/waterguy12, came back to Reddit. Coincidence? Perhaps. But let's look at the big picture here.
If


you

are unfamiliar with the legend of Waterguy12, look here. Notice that Cummy was absent in t
his thread as well. We're starting to see a pattern.
u/waterguy12 has somet
hing to
do with the disappearance of u/cummybot2000. Somet
hing is very wrong here. I
don't know what Waterguy12, and perhaps the other Guy12s, have
done with our Cummy but I'm not going to just stand by and let them
do it. I'm going to take the fight to them. Wish me luck, fellow Pastafarians.

you people get hurt feelings because grown adults like to cum and squirt but that's not my problem, it's

your boyfriend it's because

him whether it's my hot mouth or delicious tart asshole. So if


you have a fucking problem I suggest


you come to Rockland and fucking start with me and see what fucking happens. I'll be waiting here with my father's luger and it's fucking loaded.

him with a horse tranquilizer dart but I missed and it blew out one of my car's tiresl, so i can't drive to hte vet or anyt

Ich bin A

I'm an up-and-coming producer in hollywood. After years of working on small in
die projects, I finally
hit my big break. Once I made a bit of a name for myself, I was invited to all the fancy parties with the glittering starlets and famous directors. At one gala, I had a bit too much to drink, and needed to cool
down.
I went outside onto the balcony, surveying the cityscape w
hile leaning against the railing. I initially thought I was all alone out there with my thoughs on that c
hilly December evening, but much to my surprise, Emma Stone was sitting on a bench. She looked so beautiful, wearing a lowcut sea green gown that perfectly complimented her smoldering eyes. Utterly enchanting.
Normally I would never approach someone so famous, but emboldened by the liquor in my veins, I made my way over to her.
"Evening," I said, in what I hoped was not a completely starstruck tone.
"How's it going," she replied distantly. Sadness tinged her voice, and I could tell she was not enjoying herself tonight.
"I know


you must hear t
his all the time, but


you look absolutely stunning tonight," I said. For a brief moment, a smile flitted across her face, cutting through her melancholy.
A gust of c
hill wind blew across the balcony, and Emma s
hivered. It was unusually cold for Los Angeles, and her dress would not
do her much good outside. I removed my suit jacket, offering it to her. She accepted it gratefully, draping the jacket across her shoulders.
"You can sit
down if


you want," she told me, patting next to her on the bench.
I lowered myself next to her. I was perfectly fine with sitting there in silence, but to my surprise she began to make conversation. We spoke about light, inconsequential topics for an over an hour. Our favorite restaurants, hobbies, that sort of t
hing. I even managed to make her laugh a few times, and what a laugh it was. The liquor had no effect on me any more; I was intoxicated by t
his beautiful, lovely, witty woman who for some reason seemed to enjoy my company.
"You seemed a bit forlorn when I first came out here, Emma," I said eventually. "Is everyt
hing okay?"
She sighed. "It's not
hing, really. I wouldn't want to trouble


you with somet
hing so mundane."
"It's no trouble at all."
She bit her lower lip. "I got into a bit of an argument with my manager. I told
him I wanted to take a break from movies and star in a TV show, but he told me it would be ridiculous. I know it's silly and that I've been plenty successful on the big screen. It's just that movies

are so short. Two hours, three at the most. I want somet
hing where I can develop my character over the years, perfecting the subtle nuances and evolving over time."
"It makes sense," I assured her. "You want to try somet
hing different, a new challenge to embark on to really make use of


your talents."
"Exactly!" she exclaimed, eyes lighting up. "You get me. I know I've only just met


you James, but I feel like I've known


you for a long, long time." She moved in closer to me, and I took a chance, draping my arm around her delicate shoulders. Emma did not seem to mind. No, quite the opposite in fact. She leaned into me, resting her head on my upper arm.
"So what kind of show would


you like to be on?" I asked.
Emma looked up, her eyes meeting mine. "Oh, somet
hing epic. Game of Thrones is my favorite show right now, so I'd love be on somet
hing of that magnitude. What about


you, James? What's


your favorite show?"
"Rick and Morty," I told her.
"I've tried to watch it, but it just wasn't really my t
hing," Emma said. She began to trace her finger on my chest, but I slapped it away, standing up abruptly. Red rage clouded my vision.
"To be fair," I decl

ared intensely,"


you have to have a very
high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's ni
hilistic outlook, w
hich is deftly woven into
his characterisation -
his personal p
hilosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand t
his stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say somet
hing deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," w
hich itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratc
hing their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no,


you cannot see it. It's for the smart la
dies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're wit
hin 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand."
After I finished my tirade, Emma looked stunned and hurt. But I did not c

are. Her beauty and charm had evaporated before my very eyes, and all that was left was an uncultured harlot not worthy of my attentions. Without another word, I left the party, never to see Emma again. Good riddance.

If, according to Kanye West, one good girl is worth a thousand bitches, and if, according to Lil Wayne, bitches come a dime a
dozen,
does that mean one good girl is worth $8.33?
Well, $8.35 in Canada.
In Thailand, $8.33 is about 275 Baht. 275 Baht will get


you a skanky hooker in a Thai brothel. If


you want a really good hooker, it'll cost


you at least 2000 Baht, or about $61.00. So in Thailand a good woman is worth $61.00 or $732 a
dozen.
Yes. However to further t
his, according to 2Pac Mo' Money= Mo' Bitches If


you divide out Mo',


you will see that money=bitches Therefore, 1000 moneys= one good girl.
To extrapolate further, diving with respect to "money" yields 1 money = $0.00833 T
his changes everyt
hing, because money isn't worth hardly anyt
hing.
True. A linear relations
hip between money and bitches means the equation relating money to bitches is in the form of y=ax+b, where x is money and y is bitches. Consulting the Lil Wayne theorem, if 12 bitches is worth $0.10, then one bitch is $0.0083. Therefore we know that the equation 1=a(.0083)+b must hold true and so must 12=a(.1)+b. To find the equation relating money to bitches must have "a" and "b" values w
hich satisfy the two previous equations. Since "Mo'" implies a positive linear relation, we know "a" must be positive. I have
done the math for


you and found that a=119.96 and b=.0043. So, (Bitches)=119.96(Money)
+ .0043. To find the number of good girls


you get from an amount of money, simply divide the number of bitches by 1000 (because of the Kanye West Theorem).
No but biggie said mo' money= mo' problems so money=problems and since mo' money mo' bitches, we can see that bitches=problems
Well one must first consult the "50 Cent Law": "Mo' Money, Mo' Problems". Here we see that the amount of money is proportionate to the number of problems. Then one must factor one of the basic rules of the "The Carter Theorem" : "I got 99 problem but a bitch ain't one". Here we see that without a "bitch" the average person will have exactly 99 problems. Therefore the formula must be applied: (current amount of money) (8.33) / ln[(Problems100-1 ) * (current amount of money)]bitches = worth of bitch Unfortunately t
his formula only tells us the value "a bitch" w
hich as we know is only worth one monies Therefore


you must apply [(worth of bitch) * (problems) * (money-8.33)]
+ 1 / 1000 = The value of a good girl Hope t
his helps
Yeah. No. That's not how math works. 2pac was merely stating that the derivative of Money in terms of Bitches is strictly positive. More-over, he skipped a lot of steps in
his proof and never formally published the full version. I bet


you believed Fermat's margins really were too small as well, right?
Imperial bitches is actually a unit of weight. An imperial bitch is ~111.1111111112 pounds.
Theres one fundamental law of math that Lil'Wayne forgot to include in
his calculations. We have to follow the law of "bitches ain't s
hit" theorized by
doctor dre
himself. With that principal included we can work out that if bitches aint s
hit, and a good girl is worth 1,000 bitches, a good girl is still not worth s
hit.
You're forgetting that Jay-Z published
his paper on the "Money Ain't A Thang" theory. Therefore if bitches

aren't worth s
hit then bitches

aren't money and so therefore they ARE, in fact, a "Thang".
Is that the transitive property of bitches? Is it possible that for every bitch, there is an equal and opposite good girl? That
doesn't make sense though because kanye said a good girl is worth one thousand bitches. The economics
don't make sense. Newton or kanye is wrong. They cannot both apply their laws to bitches
I t
hink the important part here is,

are we assuming that there is 1 good girl for every 1000 bitches. T
his is a very scary thought. 1/1000 females is a good girl and the other 999

are bitches. To me t
his would make my $8.33 a very good investment. I paid at least $3000 for my wife's wedding ring. Could I have bought 360 good girls in stead of 1 good girl? B/c I can't help but feel like I have overpaid for my good girl according to the genius of Kanye West and Little Weezy F. Baby. Don't get me wrong, I love my good girl wife, but I feel duped knowing she may have only been worth 8 bucks instead of 3000
It actually depends on they type of women. If it is a bakers daughter it is less since the sample size is actually larger I.E. a bakers
dozen (13) so: (.10/13)x1000=$7.69 ...0r $9.69 Canadian (not counting the maple syrup)
How much candy


you can buy for $8.33?
We can conclude that 1 bitch is worth approximately 0.83c, but since bitches

are of negative value it's actually -0.83c. T
his means that in order to get the correct positive value of a good girl there needs to be an exponential factor involved here. In order to evaluate the amount of good girls needed to offset the bitches


you use the simple formula -0.0083B2 = G. T
his intuitively makes sense when


you t
hink about how the more bitches


you have around


you the exponentially
higher value even a single good girl has. So when B=1000 we get: G = -0.0083(1000)2 = $68.89 Interestingly enough, if the entire female population of the US, let's say 150 million for simplicity, were bitches, the worth of one good girl would then be $1,550,025,000,000 w
hich is just over the total USD currently in circulation.

you. Step 1: Telephone a Domino's Pizza Eatery and Restaurant and order a large one topping pizza and the guy will say, "What topping would


you like?" And


you say, "I'd like my topping to be another steaming hot Domino's one topping pizza." So the guy asks, "What topping would


you like on


your Domino's one topping pizza topping?" And then


you say, "Go ahead and make my second Domino's one topping pizza topping a Domino's one topping pizza." And then the guy will ask, "Ok sir, what topping would

you respond with, "A Domino's one topping pizza." And continue to order Domino's one topping pizza toppings, until


you

are at a pizza topped with 71 Domino's one topping pizzas, and then the pizza guy will say, "Wait one moment, sir. We

You t
hink that just because I masturbate to furry porn I'm a furry? T
hink again, maggot. The furry fan
dom is a breeding ground for the most advanced autism t
his planet has ever seen. Every day, thousands

are consumed by a tidal wave of OwO and cancerous roleplaying, and the foundations of our society slowly weaken under the constant onslaught of weapons-grade cringe. Our founding fathers recoil in disgust as people dress up as animals and buy giant dil
dos on the Internet, fucking each other in sweaty drunken homosexual orgies and traumatizing c
hildren in droves. Every second we draw closer to Furry Armaged
don, and


you sit there saying stupid s
hit on the Internet. To comp

are someone to a furry is the most heinous insult imaginable. When


your
door gets broken
down by a rainbow wolf/deer hybrid and


you get yiffed into oblivion, then we'll see who's laug
hing. T
his is a real threat and it must be treated with extreme solemnity.

Ok, let me break it
down for


you numb skulls who STILL
don't seem to get it;
WEED is not a 'DRUG', it is a PLANT. By that logic


you would be saying that flowers

are 'drugs' or apples

are 'drugs' because they all grow from the ground. Simple enough for


you're t
hick brain? Good.
Second of all, WEED has been 100% PROVEN by STEPHEN HAWKING (sound familiar? Only the dude who invented TIME TRAVEL) to CURE CANCER. That's right! The only reason weed isn't legal is because George W. Bush invested in big pharmaceutical and is making literally thousands off cancer medication.
T
hirdly, weed actually makes


you smarter contrery to popular belief. Oh,
don't believe me? My older brother smokes it all the time and he got a 70 in
his VCE and he didn't even study that hard.
Fourthly, yes I've had sex and yes I'm good at
doing it. The only reason I haven't
done it more is because I've been really busy with my league of legends team because we're training to compete in TOKYO in 2019.
Fithly, NO I haven't smoked weed before. I'm keen to try it though and if I asked my older brother he would probably give me some of
his because he knows I'm MATURE for my age.
Sixly, I t
hink mum is getting me a Ninten
do Switch for Christmas w
hich is REALLY nice of her seeing as I know her s
hifts have been cut lately at the nursing home.
OK!!!
Hopefully that should clear up a few t
hings for


you DUMB SKULLS!

The exact moment I knew I was gay is when I first started watc
hing SpongeBob. I didn't know what it was about
him that made me want
him so badly, but every time an episode came on my dick became rock solid. I knew I wanted to
do more than merely watch t
his sponge. I wanted to fuck
his tight little juicy asshole. For years, I dreamed of pounding
him from be
hind and filling
him with my cum and watc
hing it drip out of
his pores. However, no matter how many times I choked my c
hicken to the mere thought of
him, my lust for t
his sexy succulent sea sponge could not be satisfied. I tried everyt
hing, body pillows,
dolls, even
hiring a prostitute to dress up in a SpongeBob costume and suck my cock. Not
hing was good enough. So, I made it my number one goal to create a hyper-realistic SpongeBob sex
doll, so my fantasies could finally be brought to life. No longer will those who also have a unquenchable t
hirst for Mr. Squ

arePants have to dream of releasing their sticky seed inside of
his anal cavity, for they can now enjoy the real t
hing. But, creating t
his sex
doll would not be an easy task, and t
his I knew.  That's why I need


your help to fund t
his Kickstarter. For
donating $20,


you get a T-s
hirt that says "I'm gay for SpongeBob Squ

arePants." For $40,


you get the s
hirt and a coffee cup decorated with the finest SpongeBob rule 34. For $60,


you get SpongeBob anal beads. For $100,


you get a SpongeBob fleshlight that


you can jizz in or whatever, plus all the other s
hit. Anyt
hing less than $20, and I'll just cum in a shoe box and mail it to


your
door, because fuck


you I
don't need


your peasant change. I would like to make the world a better place with t
his SpongeBob sex
doll, because I believe that everyone deserves the right to stick their dick in a fictional sponge from a kid's show.

I hope


you realise how unfunny


you

are. My father happens to be in the US army and he has many guns and he will not hesitate to find


you and shoot


your 12 year old ass. I also happen to be a member of the scouts and they have taught me many tracking skills that will be needed to hunt


you
down like a
dog. You understand me idiot? Good

does finger on neck gesture
You're dead meat, kid.

Stop fucking copying and pasting my comments. I am not
doing t
his to make


you laugh. T
his is a legitimite cry for help. So stop liking it like I am some sort of a circus animal. I just need someone to tell me that it's gonna be okay or I will end it all soon.

They just HAD to
do it, didn't they? I'm GENUINELY at a loss right now. It's the only place where I felt at home, where I get to enjoy the company of people like ME, where I get to sympat
hize with individuals who's in the same predicament as I am. Again and again we

are set aside by the majority, by the 'normal', by the 'standard'. Why
do most of


you feel the need to crush us. We

are already broken as it is, and


you still desire to crush us further by banning our sub? You

are probably t
hinking right now, 'who c

ares about how t
his misogynistic sociopath feels, better root them out now before they turn into rapists and murdurers.' You misunderstand, Outside we
don't act like how we post in r/incels. It is our only means of releasing t
his pent up and clovered mess of emotions inside us. But now, our mouths

are shut. What am I supposed to
do with these emotions now? 'Seek mental health, go to X, go to Y.' Tell


you what, time and time again, everyt
hing I've said falls into deaf ears, I've been into one for 5 years now and it
does jack s
hit. 'mhmmm such a shame, take these medications' 'mhmmm have


you tried sharing


your s
hit hobbies to others? now come back next week'. FUCKING nignogs. They're only sucking my finances dry for fuck's sake, they're only there because it's their job, because it gets them money. r/incels on the other hand truly understood my problem because they have my problem. I am GENUINELY and UNIRONICALLY shedding a tear right now.

I'm beside myself with grief. I came home yesterday with a surprise gift for my 13 year-old daughter. I had t
his beautiful fluffy big pink teddy bear in my arms for her. I knew she would be thrilled. However, when I walked into her room, I found her naked with two niggers. One was fucking her in the asshole, pulling out and slapping her ass pink, and then fucking her some more w
hile the other was getting blown by her. She pulled her mouth off the spear chucker's cock and exclaimed, "Daddy!" and just then he came in her face. I grabbed a baseball bat from my son's room and chased those niggers, but they were too fast for me and got out of the house. It was weird watc
hing them run
down the street naked. I hoped someone would tackle them, but everyone was too afraid. Those savages

are strong as apes after all.
When I got back to my daughter's room, she was rubbing her pink'n'sore molested butt and crying. She kept sobbing, "I'm sorry, Daddy, I'm sorry." I'm just beside myself with grief and
don't know where I went wrong as a p

arent. Maybe it wasn't me. Her mom was a cheating whore. She was always out partying and screwing jigabooes. She especially loved muscly nigger football players. I found out she had been counseling my daughter (who was 5 at the time) that it's just as easy to fall in love with a rich sports hero nigger as it is to fall in love with a tiny dicked w
hite guy with a regular job. When I heard her say that, that's when I went apes
hit and tore all her clothes off and w
hipped her ass with a leather strap then threw her outa the house naked. She never came back, but I suspect t
his trauma might be why my daughter's going nuts and is enjoying black schlong in her cunt and in her ass.
I'm hoping there's still some chance of salvaging her decency, but that's gonna be a tall order after she's already been experiencing the thrill of huge black cocks in her every orifice. We have an appointment with our minister who's going to counsel her about the dangers of being a lustful and wanton little horny slut. Any advice on how I should deal with t
his is appreciated. I'm just beside myself with grief.

Who

are the mythbusters? Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman. Between them they have more than 30 years of special effects experience. Joining them: Grant Imahara, Tory Belleci, and Kari Byron. They
don't just tell the myths; they put them to the test.

I'm pretty sure fucken every guy has tried their own fucken cum. It's just a curiosity t
hing man, I was curious what it was like. I wanted to see what all the fucken hype was about. Alright, I was t
hirteen years old, I'd just discovered wanking, I was like "hmm I wonder what my load tastes like", so I had a little taste, alright. Don't fucking judge me dude, I reckon half of


you fuckers did it man. Half of


you cunts probably did it and


you're all just denying it man,


you're all just denying it. I did it once okay, I was


young, and I wanted to try it, okay. You

Let's dispel once and for all with t
his fiction that Barack Obama
doesn't know what he's
doing. He knows EXACTLY what he's
doing. Barack Obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change t
his country, to make America more like the rest of the world.
That's why he passed Obamac

are and the stimulus and Dodd-Frank and the deal with Iran. It is a systematic effort to change America. When I'm president of the United States, we

are going to re-embrace all the t
hings that made America the greatest nation in the world and we

are going to leave our c
hildren with what they deserve: the single greatest nation in the
history of the world.

Wear somet
hing casual, but not too casual. Have a paper copy of


your driver's license ready, with


your phone number on the back side. You go in to buy somet
hing, like a coke or a protein shake, and some beef jerky.
Then


you scratch


your butthole with


your
dominant index finger. Trust me, it will make sense later.
You go to the cash register where she is, keep a natural grin on


your face, not a creepy one. Just a relaxed one that invokes the idea that


you

are having a decent day so far.
You put the stuff on the counter, and as she scans it,


you look out the win
dow and say, "Wonderful weather we're having. Perfect day for committing a rape." Follow up with a hearty chuckle, then look her in the eyes and ask her, "What time

are


you getting off tonight?"
You remember


your butthole finger? That's right, before she answers, place that finger suavely on her lips and say, "Depending on


your answer, I may be getting off at around the same time, if


you know what I mean."
Take


your paper License and stuff it in her cleavage. Make sure


you really get it in there to the sweaty part. Then smoothly walk out the store, and never look back.
If t
hings go right,


you will be detained in a jail or prison, where


you will meet other men who actually know how to charm a woman. PS,


you will definitely get raped, but meh, minor detail.

Lego bricks

are sexist as fuck and everybody who uses them

are sexist male scum that should
die, the tubes fit into slots and thats how they fit together, but

are there any hole to hole pieces? No. Any tubes to tube pieces? NO. And i'm so pissed that there has never been a transgender lego minifigure, or an asexual minifigure, or a Bigendered minifigure, and all the lego figures have the same molds, the same shape of body, wheres the diversity? Why cant there be overweight figures? Why not anorexic ones? Oh, because it would be dumb? Fuck


you, fuck lego, fuck everybody.

Why haven't they made a spongebob fleshlight? T
hink about it: it would be so soft, squishy, and there

are enough holes in
him that


your friends could insert their wieners inside of
him at the same time as


you. I
don't know about


you but spongebob has always turned me on. Just the thought of an innocent, c
hildren's cartoon character turned into a penis sucking mac
hine makes
him 10x hotter. It could even have a suction cup on the bottom so


you could mount it to the wall. In my opinion t
his is a perfect business idea, and it would satisfy many of my needs.

If I ever happened to run into kanye on the streets I wouldn't know what to
do. I'd see
him walking towards me and be like "oh s
hit oh s
hit oh s
hit" I wouldn't want to interrupt
him, he's with
his kid and talking to
his wife. They get closer. I look at my phone hoping he
doesn't notice me noticing
him, but I kinda
do want
him to notice me so he knows I know who he is. I
don't want to bother
him because the paparazzi have probably been on
his ass for a w
hile now, and
his body guards just got them to leave. They're finally enjoying the peace. He's 5 feet away now walking at a brisk pace. They start to go silent as I get closer, knowing full well i might interupt their conversation. I look up and wave at
him. I
don't want to interrupt them. I
don't want to end up as a dinner conversation later that night. I know I would end up as a conversation. I'm awkward as fuck. He give me a nod, the kind that


you would give if


you accidentally made eye contact with a stranger


you
don't know. Kim ignores me completely, eyes straight ahead. North
doesnt even notice I was there, she's focused on somet
hing else. I already regret the action I've made, but I know it's the right one. I walk a few more feet before stopping to turn around, with the hope that he has a free minute in
his day to turn around and take the thanks and praise i have to give to
him. He
doesn't. Kanye
doesn't owe me anyt
hing, w
hile I owe kanye everyt
hing. I'm just a being. He's a fucking God. I catch a final glimpse of
him before he turns a corner. He's gone. "That was kanye west" I w
hisper to myself. I have no proof I saw
him, but I saw
him. I just saw Kanye West.

How
does it feel knowing I was lucky generically to be born as one of the few 5% attractive guys in the world who can get any attractive woman? Literally not
hing


you can
do school, work, c

areer, etc will help


you get laid more than me simply because I was lucky to
hit the genetic lottery? Every time


you see a gorgeous girl and desperately t
hink to


yourself "I wish she'd give me a chance" I want


you to remember that assholes like me fuck her without even earning it or even trying. So enjoy


your internet upvotes and DnD but in the real world where it matters


you ain't s
hit. Hey but at least


you got upvotes right? The bitches loves guys who get upvotes lol loser.


Since i was a


young boy my father has imposed
his religion onto me. I was home schooled because we live in the west and my father wanted me in an environment that was free from anyt
hing Haram. I couldn't associate with Jews or Christians, anyone who ate unclean animals, or any girl. As a teenage guy going through puberty t
his was naturally a living nightm

are. After years of begging from me and pressure from
his colleagues, i was finally allowed to attend a very nice coed
high school. The only rule was that i had to keep avoiding anyt
hing Haram. Being free for the first time i started to celebrate. Ate bacon my first day, had Christian friends in a week, and wit
hin the month i had even met a girl. I was shy and awkward as i could possibly be but she liked me and thought i was funny. She was a little too
hipster punk for me, listing to music i've never heard and using words like tubular and bae, but i loved it. Wit
hin two months we were dating. It was going great until my father heard about it. The Christians and bacon he could overlook, but the women to
him were really wrong. To
him t
his was too much and he even claimed me of having sex with her. As if it couldn't get any weirder he actually demanded i show
him my penis to prove i haven't been having sex. I had to ask
him twice to make sure i heard
him right. It was awkward but living under
his roof i had to
do as he commands. I started to go out with her on dates and every time i came home i had to w
hip it out for dad. It might be insane, but i actually am ok with dicks out for haram bae.

Yesterday i took an iq test but instead of the usual questions they showed me an episode of Rick and Morty and asked me to explain all of the jokes. Since i'm a genius I was easily able to
do so. I explained all the references from the fact that "bird person" is based off Greek mythology, to the theory that Rick is inspired from a character in ancient mongol literature. As a result they told me I have an iq of 190 if not
higher. I pity the peasants who t

Girl gamers

are pathetic narcissistic trash. With their pawg chubby bo
dies, and their s
hitty taste in games. They can't even enjoy playing a game unless someone is watc
hing them. They c

are less about the game, and more about the attention.

To be quite frank, one
does need to have a rather significant amount of intellect to comprehend Richard & Mortimer. Why, just yesterday I attempted to show my cousin (who has just entered
his seventh year) the episode where the titular character, Rick, turns
himself into a pickled cucumber. He laughed at the mere thought of a man become fermented vegetable, but I sat there watc
hing, lamenting the deeper message: the death of intellectual pursuit, the desensitization to societal filth, muck, and mire, and the shameless aban
donment of psychological understanding.
At the end my cousin turned to me and proclaimed, "I am the scientist that was once named Rick, but I have now become a pickled cucumber. Look at me, I am pickled Rick!", and I could not help but smile, not that the line he had just recited was humorous, but at the realization that t
his, in front of my very eyes, was the sum of what the episode had just warned against.
I cannot blame my cousin just as much as a man cannot blame a
dog for consuming its own bile. It merely
does not know any better, and what could be said about a man who judges t
hings he
does not have merit to judge?

hey, sorry i saw

Goddamnit I'm so fucking sick of hearing about the stupid fucking gorilla from

does that have to

I t
hink Minecraft is the coolest game ever! What isn't great about a game that


you can build in! And i t
hink that it is great that it is also the first ever game invented and it's still popular! I t

hink that it could be everyones favorite game ever it is the best by the way and I t
hink that it is cool by the way and


you should go plahy it! It is really cheap and if

iPhone is the best console, and nobody could ever fucking speak against it. When I first got an iPhone, I was so excited that I wouldn't be trashy anymore. I got so many friends with the iPhone 5C's stunning colors and sexyness, and that isn't even half of it. It has over 30 GB worth of data. I was able to store, if I recall, 10,000 photos and it would only take up 4 gigabytes. It would play games that would seem laggy to a console and turn it into a lagless portable experience. I am a true fucking gamer, I play Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja, Flappy Bird, and Clash of Clans daily, I can message friends and stay up to date, I can talk to people with my face and always remember how my friends looked like, I can take endless photos with no worry about using data, and I could browse infinite pages of the internet, w
hich a s
hitty console can't
do. The PC, Wii, PS4, and Xbox 1 can't
do any of t
his s
hit. Compete with that, consoletards. Also, nice trolling fucko, with


you're not including


you're fucking iPhone, get


your facts strate Android fuckers.

Hello guys, I'm back from my 600 seconds timeout. During that time I was able to finish my 200 words essay on the topic of Nazi Germany. My thesis is that Hitler & Nazi beliefs

are carried on by TwitchTV Nazi moderators who like to act as if they themselves were literally Hitler. I t
hink I should score at least 90 out of 100 points for that paper.

I just did sex so hard to t
his girl. She was moaning and stuff and I did sex so hard and so good with her. She was all "Please have good sex with me" and I said back "Yeah, I'm going to really sex


you so great lady" and she's like "Thanks". It was so good and so hot and we both loved
doing sex in all positions. At the end I was all "Hey, I'm going to finish sex now" and she said "Yes, that would be nice if


you finished so hard on that towel". I said "Yes" and so I finished so hard on the towel.

I
don't even understand why the hell people keep saying t
his. Even a thread on these boards says it.
How is t
his okay and what callous heartless person made t
his into a goddamned meme?
There is not
hing nice about what happened. It is fucking horrifying and appalling and miserable.
Stop spreading t
his "nice" meme. There

are t
hings to joke about and t
hings to not joke about.
Grow the hell up.

So some of


you guys may have seen t
his already and I am truly frightened.... We ALL have lost a good friend. You all know whom I am talking about. Our very own CummyBot2000. He hasn't made any comments in 19 hours. Does anyone know what has happend to the valuable member of our community? What is to come of our dear CummyBot2000??

his job is to fight off ghosts and keep their sex mansion poltergeist free so they can plot/film more amateur furry porn to make money from. Luigi's mansion might just be 'the' original castle where their shenanigans all began, who knows.

I sexually Identify as a meme. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of being uploaded onto the imgur website and linked into the reddit threads. People say to me that a person being a meme is Impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I
don't c

are, I'm beautiful. I'm having a computer scientist put my brain into my computer like johnny depp in transendence, equipping me with the dankest of pictures from the internet. From now on I want


you guys to call me "Sir Danks-a-lot" and respect my right to meme from above and meme needlessly. If


you can't accept me


you're a memephobe and need to check


your internet privilege. Thank


you for being so understanding.

I did the math and research. According to Wikipedia, the average length of a penis varies from 5.1 to 5.9 inches. I went for a safe 5.5 inches for an average. The average radius from the core center of the penis to the skin on the outside is .75 inches. From t
his we can roughly find the volume with pi timed radius squ

ared times height. T
his comes around as the average penis being around 9.72 cubic inchesNext I found the volume of the average human adult male. I had to first find the weight, w
hich according to Alex Schlessingerman's "The Physics Factbook" is 70kg or 154 pounds. Weight is found by multiplying an object mass by the force of gravity, 9.81 meters per second. After taking gravity out of the equation, the average mass of an adult human male is 7.14 kg. I then found the volume by dividing t
his number by the average density of a human, according to Wikipedia, 985 kg per meter cubed. The volume of the adult male was then found to be .0072516316 cubic meters. Utilizing the volume of the average penis I found earlier, 9.72 in cubed, I get .0001592828 meters cubed. T
his means the penis is 2.19% of an adult male's volume.Assuming a lack of testosterone or female hormones makes the person a female, balls ignored for ease, fucking a trap is only 2.19% homosexual.

Is t
his sub mostly just Republicans circlejerking? I'm probably gonna get
downvoted here, but seriously, just after reading a few comments on posts on the front page today, common and debunked gems of Republican propaganda constantly pop out. Stuff like: "Assassinating Caesar was the only option and Brutus did it to save the Roman Republic" (t
his one's particularly bad), "Pompey was bad, but not nearly as bad as Augustus", "The Varian Disaster is the beginning of the end for the Principate", "Caesar's civil war was the war between good (Optimates) and evil (Popul

ares)" (I wonder where
does Cicero fit on t
his moral scale). These sort of
historical hallucinations

are no longer taken seriously even in Roman academia (and regarded as what they actually

are: post-war propaganda), but continue to be spouted by some conservatives in the Empire and

are really just as bad as most excuses Augustus uses. Seriously,
do people still believe t
his mythology in 16AD? And if


you
do, sorry for ruining


your circlejerk.

I sexually identify as a Pawn Star. Ever since I never knew what was gonna come through that

don't c

you can't accept me


you're a Hossiphobe and need to check


your pawn privilege. Thank


you for being so understanding.

I feel like Rick Sanchez when I play Terraria. It is one of the few games that allows me to excercise such control over my worlds, like Rick would
do to
his many universes in the show. If my world is staring me
down, telling me to get good, I
don't get good. I change the world so that it is good for me, similar to the many times Rick has changed timelines when somet
hing went wrong. Has one of my NPCs
died? Not to worry, there

are infinite replacements for them that can appear at ran
dom. Has the corruption completely overtaken my world? No worries, I can just move to another one. In my Terraria worlds, I can control them like no other life form can. I am the omnipotent god of Terraria worlds, like Rick is the ni
hilistic Szechaun god of
his multiverse. I often find myself modifying my playstyle to become more like Rick. About my world, if I may quote the show, I DON'T GIVE A FUUUUUUUUUCK!!! Not
hing matters, there

are infinite everyt
hings, and we all need to realise t
his when playing the game. We ALL should play like Rick Sanchez, as it is a far superior playstyle to others due to its nature (and, obviously, the character it was based on).

cory in the house is not a better anime than king of the
hill. for the most part i agree that it is better than king of the
hill, but i have several problems with it:

season 17 was far too religious for my liking with the whole satanic curse and rapture t
hing
the rape scene in season 4 episode 7 was unnecessary ass we have already been shown how much of psychopath Mr. president is. all it did was make we cry for an hour and a half
the battle between cory and the order of the old gods was far too long. i felt like they were just drawing it out to make more money
there was a huge plot hole in season 3 when the w
hite house was teleported to the realm of chaos. shouldn't the celestial barrier that newt put up in season 1 stopped the magic circle from being completed

other than those few point i have to agree that cory in the house is one of the best animes ever made

You want the truth? Pokemon Go was developed by ISIS to recruit


young members. Any Phone newer than 2015 is equipped with a tiny C4 cartridge and heat c
hip that was provided and funded by ISIS and Intel (Did


you really t
hink it was


your CPU causing


your phone to be that hot?). You know why


you find the monsters so close to people? Because they're set to be placed wit
hin proximation a person or of popular landmarks with alot of people. When


you toss that pokeball, what


you really
do is send a signal to the camera to send out some of that tiny micro-C4 (sorta like how XRays send out little particles to take pictures of


your bones). If


you play Pokemon Go,


you

are a terrorist. If


you have already played Pokemon Go,
please stop the hate. You

are killing people. lives outside of Pokemon Go matter. You must also send t
his to 10 people (copy and paste, not sh

are), and say "thanks, nitron
do" and good luck will come


your way, otherwise


you will merely be plagued by the micro-c4 nanotechnology funded by Isis and Walt Disney.

Wow! I just want to say that I'm looking at


your smile rather than

you look very pretty! Sometimes I ask myself why
do beautiful women such as

I was riding the train home from a hard squat workout and my legs were jelly, i was also wearing t
hin shorts, well the train stopped abruptly and i fell ass first into a burly middle aged man's lap and he quickly grabbed my
hips to help push me up but my legs were fried from squats and i couldnt get up right away so i bounced back on
his lap and felt
his t
hick man rod on my ass.
The feeling was so weird and spectacular at the same time, i finally managed to get up and i quietly said thanks, he then gave me a smile. The rest of the train ride back i
dont know what happened to me but i kept staring at
him and
his crotch and i would look away if he caught me lookin. And i also kept catc
hing myself licking my lips a lot and kinda sticking my butt out.
I
dont know wut happened but i t
hink t
his fuking possible phaggot mightve turned me gay. i t
hink i caught the gay from
him wtf im not gay i love women so as i was leaving the train i gave
him an angry look and said phaggot under my breath and tried to
hide my fully grown erention. ffs gay people shouldnt be allowed to be so burley and tempting to straight guys like me who just want to be normal.

Somebody nuke In
donesia. That country should not exist.
Goddammit, it's so fucking full of weeaboos who t
hink that living "close" to Japan instantly entitles them to act like they're Japanese. Not only that, but they're loudmouthed, obnoxious, inept at both English and the internet, touchy, dramawhoring and have an ungodly clique mentality that means that if


you ever insult and In
donesian, all
his Facebook friends with names like "Sakura Angel InuYasha" will flock in, Typinq Liqe T
hiS, and they will s
hit all over the site.
Not only that, but they constantly upload subpar garbage to their popup-infested free blogs and never update their file links - and in case the file is still up there, it's on some garbage file host that throws popups in


your face as soon as


you click anyt
hing at all, and requires
dozens of waiting periods and captchas to cough up a corrupted, subpar copy of what


you were looking for, tapestried with comments and links in In
donesian and packed in the most head-up-ass way possible.

What a fucking decline.
A decline of content! What happened to the content? The great quality submissions? Now it's just reposts on reposts. Honestly, how fucking lazy.
One word answer, political junk, racist s
hit. Come on. Did


you even read the side bar?! The rules?
Here's the t
hing. You said a "I miss the old content."
Is it the same repost? Yes. No one's arguing that.
As someone who is a memeologist and chef who stu
dies copypasta, I am telling


you, specifically, in copypasta, no one calls reposts "OC". If


you want to be "original" like


you said, then


you shouldn't be submitting reposts and remakes. They're not the same t
hing.
If


you're saying "OC"


you're referring to the original content of submission w
hich includes t
hings from the Navy Seal pasta to I miss the old _______.
So


your reasoning for calling a repost "OC is because ran
dom people "change a few words around."? Let's get stolen


youtube videos and reuploads in there, then, too.
Also, calling a post a "repost" or "remake"? It's not one or the other, that's not how memeology works. They're both. An OC post is an OC post and a member of the originality family. But that's not what


you said. You said a remake is OC, w
hich is not true unless


you're okay with calling all shoes shoes and not sneakers, w
hich means


you'd call reuploads, remakes and stolen content OC too.
I'm banning


you all.

him in a cage and lay against it. "Oh Mr. Ping" I say "


you complete me."

I consider sucking dick an art form. When someone tells me to suck
his dick I view it as an honor and a privilege. Not to mention an opportunity to show off my unparalleled dick sucking skills. Most of the time, the man puts up quite the struggle and yells at me that he didn't mean it literally. But I see straight through that ruse. When I finally free that dick from
his pants and place it inside my mouth everyt
hing changes. The look of blissful ecstasy on
his face reaffirms what I already hold true in my heart. T
his is what I was born to
do. Dick is my medium and I am its master. No homo.

I love my wife more than anyt
hing on t
his planet. Normally she is very quiet and
doesn't get into altercations with anybody. Over the past week there has been a problem with kids crossing the footbridge that goes over the
highway near our house. The kids have been throwing water bombs onto the oncoming cars. Last week somebody was shocked when the balloon
hit their windscreen that they caused an accident by swerving into the car next to them.
What these kids have been
doing is so illegal but the police have yet to catch them. The council

are going to put up security cameras on the bridge but they
don't want to put one of those cages over the bridge.
My wife was driving home last night at about 20:30 when she approached the bridge. She knew all about what has been going on and could see a group of kids on top. She knew exactly what they were going to
do and she slowed
down a bit and prep

ared for the water to
hit the windscreen.
Instead a stone smashed through the glass and it's lucky there was nobody in the passenger seat or they would probably be dead or seriously injured. My wife stopped on the side of the road in distress. From the adrenaline she picked up the large 90kg rock and launched it 300 metres into the kids killing them instantly. When the police officer told me that I realised my wife was actually 18 metres tall, made of fine timber with a large counterweight and weighed over 22 tonnes. I still love my wife even if she is a me
dieval Trebuchet.

When I was in school I used to have an IQ of 15. My classmates used to harass me for not being that smart. But since 2013, my life has changed. My IQ is now 195 and it increases by 5 every time I sit
down on Sunday nights to watch t
his one show. It is called Rick and Morty. Because of that, I get all the girls and people

are always comparing me to Albert Einstein, some even say that I am the cure for cancer. When the government found out that I watch Rick and Morty, they showed up to my residence and took me to a secret facility to take an exam. The exam was about explaining all the jokes in Rick and Morty and I had to answer each question in all currently spoken languages. Since I watched Rick and Morty, I didn't have any problems and I completed it in 30 minutes. The next day, I got to see the results and I passed the exam with a score of 100%. They gave me the title "Smartest Man in Existence". Guess I am out of t
his world.

Yesterday, during our scheduled Furry Hour, my 7 year old refused to be cooperative right from the start. Eventually, he threw a tantrum, telling me "I
don't want to learn about furries anymore. T
his is stupid. I wish I could go to school like all the other kids."
Needless to say, I was devastated. I tried to tell
him that the reason I homeschool
him is because the public school system
does not respect our beliefs and practices. I reminded
him of the time
his first grade teacher called c
hild services because I barked at her during our p

arent-teacher conference. He didn't want to hear any of it though, so I just left
him alone to
do a Math worksheet.
I haven't talked to
him today yet, and I'm trying not to be upset at
him, but it's so hard. Please, have any of


your c
hildren gone through t
his phase with homeschooling, and if so how did


you handle it?

Uh, fuck

My school had even less rules. We had literally food wars at lunch. I remember having to duck and cover as a rival gang did a drive by on meatball day. A teacher got robbed by the varsity calvin-ball team. The captain of the team spent half
his sh

doing lines of coke in class to either improve their grades or to prep

Rock is actually the single worst genre in music. I know fags like to say 'haha i like anyt
hing except country haha xD XD' but let's be real. First of all, if


you say that unironically I hate


you and second of all, it really should be rock. Let's take a fuckin look at 'rock' music. Let's take a look at one of the most popular rock bands, Radiohead. The name 'rock' implies music


you can 'rock' out to, but who the fuck actually wants to rock out to some w
hiny depressing pony tail man wailing over beats that sound like they were made by Aphex Twin's retarded half-brother who likes putting guitar over t
hings. If I ever want to kill myself but can't quite commit, all I have to
do to push me over the edge is listen to Kid A. If one of the most popular bands in a genre makes me want to commit suicide, how can


you call it a good genre?

Whenever I get a package of plain M&M's, I make it my duty to continue the strength and robustness of the candy as a species. To t
his end, I make them have M&M duels.
Taking two can
dies between my forefinger and thumb, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the 'loser' and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner get to go to the next round.
I have found that, in general, brown and red M&Ms

are tougher, w
hile the blue ones

are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that blue M&Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense ring of competition and cracks under the pressure of being in the modern candy and snack food world.
Occasionally I will come across a mutation, a candy that is mishapen, pointier or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably t
his seems to be a weakness but on very r

are occassions it gives the candy extra strength. In t
his way, the candy continues to adapt in it's enviroment.
When I finish the package, I am left with one M&M. The strongest of the herd. Since it wouldn't make any sense to eat t
his one as well, I package it up with a letter that says "Please use t
his M&M for breeding purposes" and send it back to
M&M Mars, A division of Mars INC in Hackettstown, NJ
They wrote back t
his week thanking me and gve me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of M&MS.
T

There can only be one champion.

Strolling through college campus unaccompanied as I often
do. Not worried about being harassed or raped because I am a man. See group of


young la
dies struggling to set up a folding table. Two strong women have extended the legs and

are trying to flip the table upright. I approach them uninvited and say hello. One flees, triggered. "let me help with that girls" I easily flip the table upright with... my masculine strength. Now upright, I can see the sign taped to the table top. FEMINIST BAKESALE. I give a low-pitched chuckle with my testosterone privileged vocal cords. "So


you girls have been busy in the kitchen, what did


you bake?" One strong woman stands with a box to rest on the table. Her eyes

are welled with tears at the oppression she is suffering. "C-cupcakes" - "I love cupcakes, let me see what


you have there" I reach my phallic hand over and open the virginal box t
his poor woman is holding. My male gaze objectifies the cupcakes. "Oh those look good. How much?" Another strong woman speaks up, images of Susan B Anthony flash in her head. "They're a
dollar for men because of the corrupt patria--" I stop her short in a textbook case of verbal rape. "That sounds fine. Give me the whole box." I pull out a capitalist paper bill with the image of a Cis W
hite Male Slaveowner on it. The strong woman before me w
himpers in psyc
hic pain as I hand the bill to her, she has been reduced to a slave -- nay -- a commodity. "Thank


you" she says meekly, feeling violated. I give a sensual grunt as I bite into one of the sweet, moist cupcakes. "Mmmm... It was my privilege."

Who

are the mythbusters? Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman. Between them they have more than 30 years of special effects experience. Joining them: Grant Imahara, Tory Belleci, and Kari Byron. They
don't just tell the myths; they put them to the test.

you're close.
You spin inside of her.

I find indian tech support scammers voices really soot
hing. Every time I get a cold call I respond and listen to their voice, quickly pulling
down my pants and jerking myself off, I especially get horny whenever they try to "fix" my computer, it makes me shoot buckets and it drains my snake very quickly, every wrong word they say brings me closer to orgasm, like "wirus" or "dextop", i'm in pure ecstasy whenever I get to talk to these indian men and women.

Disclaimer: I'm
high as a fucking kite RN so everyt
hing that comes out of my mouth'll probably sound like some crazy-ass s
hit but that's just life.
Anyway I was just bulls
hitting around last night t
hinking about hookers and beer in the FE universe, but then I wondered how much it'd cost for hookers in the FE universe. So, of course, I pulled up some numbers and started typing away on a calculator.
When I started researc
hing s
hit gold was worth 1310.48 USD. In addition, a gold bar usually weighs 400 ounces. Using Awakening's Medium Gold Bullions as the standard of value, them costing/worth/priced at 10000 Fire Emblem Units (called FEU from now on), we can
do some pretty simple math to
do some conversions. 10000 FEU / 400 oz gives us 25 FEU for one ounce of gold, and then


you can
do the basic math to get the conversion rates between USD and FEU. Doing 1310.48 USD / 25 FEU gives


you 1 FEU = 52.4192 USD or rounded to 52.42 USD for sig figs. The other way around it gives


you 1 USD = 0.0191 FEU.
With that in mind, the professional callgirl or gigolo typically goes for 100 USD per hour. In Fire Emblem Fates, the value of an iron sword is rated at 1,000 FEU. Doing simple conversions (1000 FEU * 52.42 USD), the value of an average iron sword is placed at $52,420 (ayyy 420). Another simple conversion to find out how many hours


you can get (52,420 bucks / 100 per hour) will net


you 524 hours of paid sex for the price of an iron sword.
I probably fucked somet
hing up economically but it's still pretty cool to t
hink about anyway.

iCarly was one of the most revolutionary shows ever to grace t
his Earth. It was the pinnacle of Nickelodeon's creative talents and hard-working actors to make a truly stunning show w
hich would capture the hearts of millions. There have been absolutely no criticisms of t
his show, it is unflawed and perfect, in fact, IMDB has only 10 star reviews for t
his show. The comedy used is genius, never being repetitive and always using new gags to entertain the respectable au
dience. iCarly revolutionised the TV market, with jokes and ideas no one had ever seen before, like recounting the lives of famous fictitious teenagers' lives and milking out a show for a few years. They

are always full of witty jokes and
hilarious situations, and the character development is brilliant. I would tell everyone I know about t
his show, but sadly I have no one to talk to because I'm a lonely reviewer on the Internet who makes no money and lives in their mom's basement watc
hing iCarly everyday and moment of their lives. Overall, I'd give t
his show an 11/9, because it is of a much
higher quality and perfection than even the likes of Lazy Town and the Shooting of Harambe. Now if


you excuse me, I'm going to go jack off to iCarly porn on rule 34 and s

Hi (sorry for my English) I have a question (sorry English is my second language) about GOSTES. So my mom told me (sorry English is not my first language ) that gostes

are real and when


you
die (apologies for spelling)


your goste comes out of


your body and walks around through walls (I
don't have a dictionary sorry) for ever.
When I was 6 I saw a goste in my brother's bed and it saw me (sorry I am europe) and got sc

ared so it ran away. My friends also have seen gostes (apologise for my grammar) and on our school trip we saw a man goste walking through the wall so we chased it (very sorry for poor writing) but he had already disappe

ared.
Yesterday my brother told me MORJELLA (my name) THERE ARE NO GOSTES IT'S A LIE so I said to
him Davrik then how did I see a gostes? (Apologies)
So I said my mother MOTHER Davrik say there is no gostes? To w
hich she replied (sorry if my English is bad)
MORJELLA, YOUR BROTHER DAVRIK WAS DIE SINCE BIRTH.
So he was goste all along!
Thanks.

I remember once when my dad gave me money to pay the electricity bill but instead i bought a raffle ticket for a brand new car. When i got home,i explained to my dad what i did and he beat the crap out of me. But the next day,when my dad woke up and opened the
door,outside my house was a brand new car. We all cried especially me,because the car was from the electricity company,they were there to cut off the electricity, my dad beat the crap out of me again

Koalas

are fucking horrible animals.
They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains

are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface

area for neurons. If


you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They

are too t
hick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. T
his is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only t
hing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to t
hink, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they

are awake all they
do is eat, s
hit and occasionally scream like fucking satan.
Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest
hind gut to body ratio of any mammal.
Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break
down plant matter more efficiently...
Koalas

are no exception, when their teeth erode
down to not
hing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals.
Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here).
When the


young joey needs to transition from rich, nouris
hing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it
doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it
does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy t
his, the


young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), w
hich he then proceeds to slurp on.
T
his partially digested plant matter gives
him just what he needs to start developing
his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling
his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why?
Because koalas

are riddled with chlamydia. In some

areas the infection rate is 80% or
higher. T
his statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape.
Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or c

are, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, w
hich brings us full circle back to the brain:
Koalas have a
higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. T
his is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree.
An animal so t
hick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.
Tldr; Koalas

are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute.
If


you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet.

Fuck off. We're all piles of flesh and bones whose behaivor accords to a calculation of emotions. Dont tell me


your behaivor is better than mine because of some arbitrary value (Like "Having a life") that i
dont c

are about.

You asked for it.
Let me preface t
his by saying that my mother is very involved in volunteer work. In
high school, around 16, we had to
do a certain amount of volunteer hours to qualify for some stupid extracurricular award w
hich of course my p

arents wanted me to received so colleges would see my application and t
hink "wow, what an upstanding


young man! he definitely
doesn't masturbate to scat porn or anyt
hing like that!" and one of my mom's good friends was a catholic organizer and worked with a local convent of nuns to help the homeless. It was a soup kitchen of some sorts run by volunteers and little old nuns.
My mom thought that sounded like fun and I, being an agreeable and
docile c
hild, agreed to go. We got to the soup kitchen, w
hich was in a building adjacent to the nunnery (priory? chapter house? not sure of the terminology). We set up early in the morning, and spend the morning ladling soup into bowls for the city's
downtrodden. It was actually quite good work, really satisfying for the soul. The nuns seemed to relish in it- they didn't fit my culturally-molded view of strict, old bitches; rather, many were


young, beautiful, and friendly. It was strange. Watc
hing the nuns lovingly c

are for these wrinkly crusty homeless people was one of the most heartwarming t
hings I've ever seen.
Finally, at the end of the day, the nun in charge offered to show us their house, to see how nuns lived. As a non-religious person I was interested to see what the arrangement was like, and I said sure. My mom stayed be
hind to clean up, so me and the nun lady walked through a few
doors, up some stairs, and into what looked like a
dormitory. We had bonded during the day, and I was cracking jokes and warming her middle-aged heart. She said they usually have rules against letting men into their quarters, but I was b

arely more than a c
hild and they liked me enough. She walked me through the halls, living rooms, and

area where they stored their vestments. It was a neat, spartan environment- much like what I imagine prison in norway is like. It was uneventful but interesting, and right before she was about to take me to leave, she showed me an individual room.
"Would


you like to see Sister *****'s room? She's cleaning up and I'm sure she wouldn't mind." Of course I acquiesced and stepped into a dimly lit room with a small twin bed and an small catholic kneely-t
hing on the opposite wall with a picture of Caucasian jesus. I looked around and noticed on the bed, with my heart jumping, a lacy black thong.
The head nun must have noticed too, because she quickly ushered me out of there. Naturally I was at full mast immediately and asked her if I could quick use the restroom before I left, since everyone else was cleaning the soup kitchen. She couldn't say no, and sat
down in the living room w
hile I ran off to the nun's bathrooms, w
hich was somewhat like that of a
dorm hall bathroom.
It was the most aroused I've been in a w
hile. The thought of the gorgeous nun, filling up the cups of homeless men w
hile, beneath her habit, wearing a sexy thong. I imagined her slipping off the habit, wearing not
hing but the underwear and a crucifix. I imagined her w
hipping me, and c

aressing me w
hile talking to me about jesus. I imagined becoming a monk and sneaking in to fuck her in the ass on the altar of the church.
Of course I was in a stall masturbating and of course I was crawling around on the floor looking for a sp

are pube or two left by a tired nun getting her evening s
hit in. It was one of the best beat sessions of my life: clean, but


you could still get a
hint of bodily fluid o
dor in the air, and I was in proximity to a house of sexy nuns. It was a fetish I didn't even know I had.
I must have been in there a w
hile, gasping and stroking, because there was a knock at the bathroom
door (w
hich didn't lock, being a
dorm style bathroom). "

are


you in there?" I quickly realized that I hadn't even closed my stall
door in all my excitement, because everyone was gone, and before I could make a move, the bathroom
door opened and there stood the nun c
hief, staring openmouthed at me, perched on a toilet like a bird with my cock in my hand and my eyes rolled up in the back of my head.
"GOODNESS!" She cried, and backed into the hallway. At that point, I couldn't stop (can't stop won't stop) and came buckets all over the stall. It was a 6 roper, if anyone was interested. I washed my hands, stepped out (she was nowhere to be found), ran
down to the
door, and reached the soup kitchen. I found my mom waiting at the car.
"Did


you have an interesting tour?" She asked. I replied affirmatively and asked her to take us home because I was sleepy. That load did knock me out quite well. They never asked us for volunteers at the soup kitchen again though, and to t
his day, I can't enter a catholic church without getting a massive har
don and having to run to the ne

arest bathroom to rub one out. I masturbated in 3 different Vatican bathrooms because of t
his and the huge presence of nuns there.

you <3 I know how to make a woman feel like a girl, but I won't

you >< !! Even if


you reject me it's all worth it just for


you, my wuv <3 (plz
don't reject me !!)

When we won, we didnt believe it. Everyt
hing just kept getting better, we thought it was going to crash sometime. When Trump loses, the /pol/ tears will sustain me for weeks, maybe even months. I shall descend upon t
his board like a wolf upon a lamb, and bask in the unending impotent rage that t
his board will pump out. I will gaze upon the suicide threads and rage posts, and drink deep of their w
hining. When they actually start livestreaming their own suicides and self-mutilation, Ill know true ecstasy. I
dont t
hink my penis will ever be harder than it will be when a million /pol/ tards cry out in itty bitty w
hite boi penis fury simultaneously. Theyll try to convince themselves it was a rigged election. Theyll try to convince themselves that the Jews had pulled a fast one on them. We will riot! They will say. Race war! Day of the rope! they will cry. Time will pass, and they will
do not
hing because they only talk. They

are too cowardly and weak to
do anyt
hing. But best of all, none of their bitc
hing will balm the pain of knowing that their God Emperor, their hero, will go
down in
history as an embarrassment, as an amusing footnote at best, as the loud obnoxious asshole who lost to the first WOMAN president. The entire nation KNOWS that Hillary is a literal criminal, that shes practically bathed in the blood of 4 dead Americans, intimidated Bills rape victims into silence, and her administration will surely be mired in constant scandals and et
hical breaches. But all t
his only drives home just how little the American people t
hink of Trump. After all her bulls
hit, her crimes, her lies, they STILL see Hillary as being superior to Trump. When the denizens of /pol/ come to t
his realization, they shall know true, soul-crus
hing, all-encompassing despair. Exquisite shall be their pain. I will look into their eyes and watch their spirit break, and wont reach my climax a moment sooner.
I need to fap.

It has been 4 hours since I successfully sucked my own penis. T
hings

are different now. As soon as mouth-to-penis contact was made I felt a shockwave through my body. I have reason to believe I have super strength and telekinesis now.. 3 hours after contact I noticed a van parked on my street but no one has entered or exited the car since its arrival. I fear for my safety, I'm not sure what sort of power I may have stumbled upon but it's possible that the government has found out. If I
don't update t
his again
please send help.

I was only 12 years old. I loved Cummybot so much, I read all the comments and copypastas. I pray to CummyBot every night, thanking
him for the life I have been given "Cummy is love", I say, "Cummy is life" My dad hears me and calls me a faggot. He is obviously jealous of my devotion to CummyBot. I call
him a twat. He slaps me and sends me to my room. I am crying now, because my face hurts. I go into my bed and it is very cold. I feel a warmth moving towards me, I fell somet
hing touch me, It's Cummybot! I am so happy. He w
hispers into my ear, "T
his is my s
hitpost" He grabs me with
his powerful bot hands and puts me on my hands and knees I'm ready I spread my ass cheeks for CummyBot He penetrates my butthole. It hurts so much, but I
do it for Cummybot. I can feel my anus tearing as my eyes start to water. I push against
his force, I want to
please Cummy. He cums a mighty cum as he fills my butt with
his love. My dad walks in. Cummybot looks
him deep in the eyes and says, "It's all copy pasta now." Cummy leaves through my win
dow. Cummybot is love, Cummybot is life.

I t
hink Islam is pretty cool. Other religions

are so boring. Praying, loving and s
hit but Islam is always action. Driving a transporter into a crowd, cutting some throats, blowing somet
hing up, screaming Allahu Abkar(w
hich is super cool). It's like GTA with better grap
hics but without stupid cheaters.

Hello am 48 year man from somalia. Sorry for my bed england. I selled my wife for internet connection for play "conter stirk" and I want to become the goodest player like

No. You're wrong. You're so wrong. T
his meme is the best meme that has ever existed, and there is no way that no matter how much attention that it gets, that it will ever get beaten to death. IT is pure, and that cannot happen.
The raw material of the meme is pure, not cancerous. Have


you listened the original We Are Number One, or even Cooking By the Book? These

are not just memes, they

are incredible songs, almost not worthy of a kids show. They

are talented pieces of art, and if


you disrespect them again, I promise


you that I will find where


you live and
do unspeakable t
hings to


you and


your mother. Please, if


you wish to live a peaceful life, stop spreading blasphemy.

OK, I cann b

do boss.

My first time on Club Penguin I was a 9 year old girl.  There was some kid named somet
hing generic like "cutesurferboy13."  He said he was 14 so I said I was 13.  The next message has been immortalized in my brain.
"
do u have a nice but"
For whatever reason I fucking panicked.  I felt hot like the walls were closing in on me and I couldn't breathe.  A sense of imminent
doom descended upon me.  I had never been confronted with somet
hing of a sexual nature t
his way.
I frantically typed "i am 9 srry"
I logged off and never logged back on again.

Donald Trump answers the question: What is 2+2?
"I have to say a lot of people have been asking t
his question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me and they ask me. They say, "What's 2+2"? And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math


you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if


you want to know what 2+2 is,
do


you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell


you.
First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros be
hind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I
don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, "10101000101", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I
don't know. I mean,


you know.
So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did


you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they
don't tell


you that, and I'll tell


you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell


you. So, we're gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me. OK? Alright. Thank


you."

So, as


you may already know, vaping requires 1 (or sometimes 2) hands to be off the keyboard for about ~5-10 seconds w
hile I'm taking a rip, w
hich happens about once a minute. During t
his time I'm usually forced to be AFK in a corner or somewhere relatively safe. T
his means that I basically can't
do anyt
hing for about 20 seconds of every round, w
hich is a huge portion. How can I better change the timing of ripping one so that it
doesn't significantly affect my games? Should I take a rip at the beginning of the round and again towards the end or not spread them out?
Also, can t
his same technique be used with bong/other drug rips?

Eh? You've never seen a pair of breasts before? And

Japan is an island by the sea w
hich is filled with volcanoes and it's beautiful!
In the year -1,000,000,000, Japan might not have been here. In the year -40,000, it was here and


you could walk to it and some people walked to it. Then, it became warmer, some icebergs melted, it became an island and now there

are lots of trees! (because it's warmer.)
So now, there's people living on the island. They're basically just sort of hanging out inbetween the mountains, eating nuts off trees and using the latest techology like stones and bowls. Ding-
dong! It's the outside world and they have technology from the future like really good metal and crazy rice farms. Now,


you can make a lot of rice really really quickly. That means if


you own the farm,


you own a lot of food w
hich is somet
hing everybody needs to survive so that makes


you king. Rice farming and rice king
doms spread across the land all the way to here. The most important king
doms were here, here, here, here, here, here and here, but t
his one was the most most important, ruled by a "heavenly superperson" or "Emperor" for short.
Knock-knock. Get the
door, it's religion. The new prince wants everyone to try t
his hot new religion from Baekje. "Please try t
his religion." he said.
"No." said everybody.
"Try it!" he said.
"No." said everybody again, quieter t
his time.
And so, the religion was put into place and all the rules had came with it.
Then, the government was taken over by another clique and they made some reforms, like making the government govern more and making the government more like C
hina's government more like C
hina's government, w
hich is a government that governs more.
"Hi, dips
hit." said C
hina.
"Can


you call me somet
hing else other than dips
hit?" said Japan.
"Like what?" said C
hina.
"How about Sunrise land?" said Japan.
And they stole C
hina's alphabet and wrote a book about themselves and then they made lots of poetry and art and another book about themselves.
Then, they stopped moving the capital every time the Emperor
died and kept it in one place for a w
hile, right here, and they conquered the north, finally. Get that squ

ared away.
A rich
hipster named Kukai is bored with modern Budd
hism, visits C
hina and learns a better version w
hich is more spiritual, comes back, reinvents the alphabet and causes art and literature to be great for a long time and the royal palace turned into such a dream world of art that they really didn't give a s
hit about running the country.
So if


you live outside the palace, how

are


you supposed to protect


your s
hit from criminals? Hire a samurai! Everyone started
hiring samurai.
CORRECTION: Rich, important people
hired samurai. Poor people who could not afford to
hire samurai did not
hire samurai.
The samurai became organised and powerful, more powerful than the government, so they made their own military government here. They let the Emperor still be "Emperor" but the Shogun is actually in control.
BREAKING NEWS: The Mongols have invaded C
hina. "We've invaded C
hina." said the Mongols. "Please respect us or we will invade


you as well."
"Okay." said Japan. So the Mongols came over, ready for war, and
died in a torna
do but they tried again and had a nice time fighting with the Japanese but then
died in a torna
do.
Then, the Emperor overthrows the Shogunate then the Shogunate overthrows
him back and then moves to Kyoto and makes a new Shogunate and the Emperor can still dress like an Emperor if he wants, that's fine.
Now there's more art like painting with less colours, collaborative poetry, plays, monkey fun, tea parties, gardening, arc
hitecture, flowers...
It's time for "Who's going to be the next Shogun?" Usually, it's the Shogun's kid but the Shogun
doesn't have a kid so he tries to get
his brother to quit being a monk and be the next Shogun. He says "ok," but then the Shogun has a kid. So now, who's it going to be? Vote now on


your phones! Everyone voted so hard that the palace caught on fire and burned
down. The Shogun actually didn't c

are. He was off somewhere
doing poetry.
And the whole country broke into pieces. Everyone is fighting with each other for local power and it's anybody's game.
Knock-knock. It's Europe. No, they're not here to take over. They just want to sell some s
hit like clocks and guns and Jesus.
So that's cool, but everyone's still fighting each other for control, now with guns! And wouldn't it be nice to control the capital, w
hich right now is puppets with no-one controlling them? T
his clan is ready to make a run for it but first, they have to trample t
his smaller clan w
hich is in the way. Surprise! Smaller clan wins and the leader of that clan steals the idea of invading the capital and it goes very well.
He's about halfway through conquering Japan when someone who works for
him kills
him and then someone else who works for
him kills them and that guy finishes conquering Japan! And then, he confiscated everybody's swords and made some rules. "And now I'm going to invade Korea, and then hopefully C
hina." he said and failed and also
died.
But before he
died, he told these five guys to take c

are of
his 5-year old son until he's old enough to be the next ruler of Japan. And the five guys said "Yeah, right. It's not gonna be t
his kid. It's gonna be one of us because we're grownups," and it's probably gonna be t
his guy who happens to be way more rich and powerful than the others. A lot of people support
him but a lot of people support not supporting
him. They have a fight and he wins and starts a new government right here, E
do, and he still lets the Emperor dress like an Emperor and have very nice t
hings but
don't get confused. T
his is the new government and they

are very strict. So strict, they closed the country. No-one can leave and no-one can come in except for the Dutch if they wanna buy and sell s
hit but they have to
do it right here.
Now that the entire country was not at war with itself, the population increased a lot. Business increased. Schools were built. Roads were built. Everyone learned to read. Books were published. There's poetry, plays, sexy times, puppet shows and Dutch stu
dies. People started to study European science from books they bought from the Dutch. We're talking geography, skeletons, physics, chemistry, astronomy and maybe even electricity.
Over time, the economic and cultural prosperity began to gradually show
do-- Knock-knock. It's the United States with huge boats with guns (gunboats). "Open the country. Stop having it be closed." said the United States. There was really not
hing they could
do so they signed a contract that lets United States, Britain and Russia visit Japan any time they want.
Choshu and Satsuma hated t
his. "That sucks!" they said. "T
his sucks!!" and with almost very little outside help, they overthrew the Shogunate and somehow made the Emperor the Emperor again and moved
him to E
do w
hich they renamed "Eastern Capital". They made a new government w
hich a lot more western. They made a new constitution that was pretty western and a military that was pretty western.
And
do


you know what else is western? That's right! It's conquering stuff! So what can we conquer? Korea! They conquer Korea, taking it from its previous owner, C
hina, and then go a little bit further and Russia rushes in out of nowhere and goes "Stop, no,


you can't take that. We were gonna build a railroad through here to try and get some warm water." and Russia builds their railroad, supervised by a s
hit ton of sol
diers, and then, when the railroad is
done, they
downgraded to a fuck ton. Did I say
downgrade? I meant upgrade. And Japan says "Can


you maybe c
hill?"
and Russia says "How about maybe YOU c
hill?"
Japan is kinda sc

ared of Russia. You'll never guess who's also kinda sc

ared of Russia: Great Britain. So Japan and Britain make an alliance together so they can be a little less sc

ared of Russia. Feeling confident, Japan goes to war against Russia just for a moment and then they both get bored and stop.
It's time for World War 1! The world is about to have a war because it's the 1900s and weapons

are getting crazy and all these empires

are excited to try them out on each other. Meanw
hile, Japan is enjoying conquering stuff and wants more and the next t
hing on their list is t
his part of C
hina and lots of tiny islands, all that s
hit belongs to Germany w
hich just had war decl

ared on it by Britain because Britain was friends with Belgium w
hich was being trespassed by Germany to get to France to kick France's ass because France is friends with Russia who was getting ready to kick Austria's ass because Austria was getting ready to kick Serbia's ass because someone from Serbia shot the leader of Austria's ass (er, actually shot
him in the head) and Britain is currently friends with Japan so


you know what that means. Duh! Japan should take the islands, w
hich they wanted to
do anyway, so they called Britain on the telly to sort of let them know and they did it and they also helped Britain here and there with some errands and stuff. Ring-ring! Now, the war is over and congratulations, Japan! You technically fought in the war so


you get to sit at the negotiating table with the big dudes where they decided who owns what and yes, Japan gets to keep all that s
hit they stole from Germany! You also get to join the post-war mega-alliance The League of Nations! (whose mission statement is to try not to take over the world)
The great depression is bad and Japan's economy is now crappy but the military is
doing just fine and it invades Manchuria and the League of Nations is like "No,
don't
do that, if


you're in the League of Nations,


you're not supposed to take over the world!"
and Japan said "How about I
do anyway?" and Japan invaded more and more and more and more of C
hina and was planning and was planning to invade the entire east.
You've got mail! It's from Germany, the new leader of Germany. He has a cool moustache and is trying to take over the world and needs friends. T
his also got forwarded to Italy. They all decided to be friends because they all had so much in common.
It's time for World War 2! Germany invades the neighbours then they invade the neighbours' neighbours then the neighbours' neighbours' neighbours, who happened to be Britain said "Holy s
hit!" and the United States started helping Britain because they're good friends and started not helping Japan because their friends and our friends

are not friends plus they're planning on invading the entire ocean.
The United States is also working on a large, very huge bomb, bigger than any other bomb ever, just in case, but they still haven't joined the war. War looks bad on TV and the United States is really starting to c

are about their image but then Japan spits on them in Hawaii and challenges them to war and they say yes! And then, Germany, as a symbol of friends
hip, decl

ares war on the United States also. So, the United States goes to war in Europe and they help the gang chase Germany back into Germany and they also start chasing Japan back into Japan and they haven't used the bomb yet and

are curious to see if it works so they drop it on Japan. They actually dropped two.
The United States installed a new government inspired by the United states government with just the right ingre
dients for a post-war economic miracle and Japan starts making TVs, VCRs, automobiles and camcorders as fast as they can and also better than everybody else. They get rich and the economy goes wild and then the miracle wears off but everyt
hing's still pretty cool I guess. Bye!

Sorry to be bothering


you but could


you
do without the profanities? T
his is a family-friendly subreddit. Every Monday evening me, my grandmother and my little brother browse t
his subreddit and whatnot. It's very awkward to encounter these bad words w
hile sitting with my family.

I see Amy Schumer as a challenge, more than anyt
hing. Here is a woman who, in every single aspect, is absolutely revolting - her exterior AND her personality - yet I can't help but wonder what would be like, to plunge balls-deep into her repeatedly.
That's right. Balls-deep. With no protection.
I won't lie, I'm extraordinarily-hard w
hile typing t
his. I want to grab t
his... t
hing... and that's what Amy Schumer is, let's not delude ourselves, a "t
hing"... by the
hips and ram mercilessly in and out of her quivering, malformed cunt with the force of a gladiatorial chariot, w
hile she makes stupid faces and contorts orgasmically, unable to control her bodily reactions even if she wanted to.
I would erupt violently inside that corrupt and corrupting womb as though the entire fate of humanity depended on my seed penetrating the foul walls of one of her ovaries, the electrical fusion from t
his coupling creating the Antichrist, as our combined, guttural, Chewbacca-like roars shattered glass and walls alike around us, the house toppling
down w
hile we lay there in a filthy, disgusting mess.
Yeah. I reckon Amy Schumer
does it for me.

Let's get riiiight into the meeeemes

The Emoji Movie unlocks the never-before-seen secret world inside


your smartphone. Hidden wit
hin the messaging app is Textopolis, a bustling city where all


your favorite emojis live, hoping to be selected by the phone's user. In t
his world, each emoji has only one facial expression - except for Gene, an exuberant emoji who was born without a filter and is bursting with multiple expressions. Determined to become "normal" like the other emojis, Gene enlists the help of
his handy best friend Hi-5 and the notorious code breaker emoji Jailbreak. Together, they embark on an epic "app-venture" through the apps on the phone, each its own wild and fun world, to find the Code that will fix Gene. But when a greater danger threatens the phone, the fate of all emojis depends on these three unlikely friends who must save their world before it's deleted forever.

Our moon is so useless and pathetic comp

ared to all of the cool moons out there in the solar system. W
hile so much other moons have all these cool features, all our Moon did was
hit us, and then get a free ride orbiting us for a few billion years.
Europa is such a cool moon, that it could potentially have liquid water underneath. The gravitational effects of its planet Jupiter, and some of Jupiter's other Moons (including Ganymede, a moon so sick, it is bigger than the planet Mercury, and almost as big as Mars; Callisto, another huge ass moon bigger than ours, one that might even have water as well; and Io, a pizza coloured moon with fucking sulfuric volcanoes) cause internal movement for the body, meaning there might not only be the biggest ocean currently known in the universe there, but it could very well have geothermic vents. Geothermic vents mean that there could potentially be life there! Our stupid ass moon can't
do none of that s
hit, it's just barren.
How about Titan? Easily the biggest moon of Saturn, it is so big its gravity helps Saturn's smaller moons from cras
hing into the ringed planet - it is literally saving their lives! Could our moon
do that? Nah, it's too pathetic to
do anyt
hing of the sort. Not only that, but it is the only moon with a proper greenhouse effect going on, it literally has an atmosphere, and oceans made out of liquid methane (and some scientists t
hink there might even be water). Could our moon have an atmosphere? The flimsy little dust bubble it has around it hardly counts, it's so s
hit.
Look at our friend Triton. It was a dwarf planet in its own right, and not only any dwarf planet, but the largest one, bigger than Pluto and Eris. However, the poor t
hing was brutally captured by Neptune, and is now in a orbit around the planet, going the opposite way from the other moons to show its uniqueness. It also has geysers that throw out gaseous nitrogen that it carries around in it, creating its own atmosphere, and making it one of the 4 places in the solar system with known geological activity, apart from the Earth, Io and Saturn's Enceladus (that motherfucker is covered in fresh ice and it's of the s
hiniest t
hings in the solar system, cos it erupts water vapour). Could OUR moon have geological activity? Of fucking course not.
Even Charon is cooler than the moon, and it
doesn't even orbit a real planet. Its around half the size of Pluto, and its so massive, it actually makes Pluto wobble around a point outside of Pluto itself, making it more of a duo-planetary system then a moon. It affects the environment so much scientists say that the other moons, rather than orbiting Pluto, orbit a Pluto-Charon system. Can our tiny-ass moon
do that? No it can't.
So anyways, fuck the moon.

You guys
don't know anyt
hing. Kim Jong Un is actually a hero. T
his Switzerland educated modern age savior did not ask for the responsibility of saving the planet, and yet
his father had tasked
him with that heavy responsibility on
his death bed.
In
his last few moments before passing, Kim Jong Il explained to
his son the horrible truth: There

are horrific monsters lurking under the earth's mantle! It was their sacred duty to rid the planet from those monsters.
They couldn't reveal the truth to the rest of the world, for fear of causing panic and mass hysteria. Kim Jong Il reached out for help to the Bush administration, and to avoid surveillance, and for the purpose of plausible deniability, they used a famous basketball player who flew to North Korea, witnessed some of the captured monsters with
his own eyes, and came back to the US to give a deposition to the US secret service.
Upon learning of the horrible truth, George Bush decided to help North Korea by sending a team of nuclear physicists. Nobody could know about t
his of course, and that was the moment one of the longest running farces has been crafted. Copying from Nixon's "Madman Theory", they agreed that the North Korean leaders
hip must appear to be insane, for if any images of the monsters leak from North Korea (despite their iron hold on information and their strict censors
hip), the rest of the world would automatically assume it's a joke and would never take anyt
hing coming from North Korea seriously.
So La
dies & Gentlemen, now that


you know the truth,
please join me in supporting
his excellence, Kim Jong Un. Him and
his heroic people

are sacrificing themselves every day so that we may live in blissful ignorance, buying our Salted Caramel ice cream, our iPhones and our Teslas, w
hile North Koreans
die fighting monsters.

There once was a woman who had 100 c
hildren. She named each of them after numbers in the order they were born. There was a fire and all of them
died except Ninety. Ninety went off to have kids of her own. They were very kind and loving. One day they found an injured
dog. They took it home and nursed it back to health. They
hid the
dog and never told their mother afraid she would kick the
dog out . In fact they never told anyone. To keep from arousing any suspicions they named the
dog "T
his" so the name could be used in conversation. One day T
his ran away. They never saw T
his again. No one else knew about T
his. No one even knew a
dog named T
his existed.
Only Ninety's kids will remember T
his.

I'm Papa John and t
his is my pizza restaurant. I work here with my my son, Bow, and in 23 years I've learned one t

Do


you love to play Super Mario Brothers on the Classic Ninten
do System? Do


you like to get tagged from be
hind w
hile


you
do it? T
his is the post for


you then.
You must know


your way around the game before we meet, must be open to anal sex, also able to fake an orgasm is a plus.
I will send


you the address to a hotel and a room number. When


you arrive the
door will be open. Please come in close and lock the
door and close the shades if they

are still open. I will be in the bathroom and the
door will be closed. Turn on the TV and the Ninten
do. Remove all of


your clot
hing. Turn off all lights in the room and kneel
down on the bed so


you

are directly in the light of the TV. You need to be facing the TV with


your butt in the air pointed toward the pillows on the bed.
Press the start button on the controller when


you

are ready. I will hear the sound and turn the light off in the bathroom and come out. You will not look directly at me, only look at the TV. When the first level starts I will begin to finger


you and lick


you. I will be using lots of lube as well.
When


you reach the end of level one, make sure to trigger the fireworks. T
his is vital to the entire experience. I must hear the fireworks. When level 2 begins and Mario walks into the pipe, I will penetrate


you. You may say t
hings like, "MORE", "HARDER", "YES", "FUCK ME", but not
hing else. I will continue having sex until the level ends. DO NOT take the secret level skip. If


you
die I will pull out and spank


you until the level restarts.
When


you reach the flag


you must again trigger the fireworks, and also orgasm. I will pull out. When the 1-3 starts I will penetrate


your ass. You

are allowed to say somet
hing like "OH GOD", "YES", OR "IT HURTS" no other conversation is allowed.
When level 1-4 starts I will alternate between holes as I see fit. You may beg me to cum inside or outside of


you, depending on what


you want. When boss falls and


you reach the princess I will pull out and blow my load where


you have convinced me I want too. You may then say somet
hing like "Thanks", "It was great", "I loved it", "Don't stop"
If I am impressed


you may continue playing and I will continue to pleasure


you. If I am not, I will turn the Ninten
do Off and return to the bathroom. At t
his time


you may clean


your self with the towel that is beside the bed. Turn the lights on, redress


yourself and leave.
I may come back out and talk to


you as


you dress but the conversation will most likely be short and revolve around scheduling another time to get together.

Holy moly, that's quite a pair of titties! Down to the details, they

are just amazinf! I mean first, we have just an absolutely perfect round shape with a nice slight perk upwards. Next, we have a beautiful nipple placement, size and color. The titty location and angle on the chest is just outstanding. And lastly we have the overall titty size, looking around D, maybe DD, just a great handful, but not so much that it would sag or be overwhelming.
Overall OP,


your tits

are a solid 11/10, truly great work here.

DONT FUCKING MESS WITH ME. not only
do i get pussy at a rapid pace, so fast i like to call it PPM (pussy per minute) i have so many bitches at my disposal it's like a sperm bank in my house bahaha!

hide all the bitch porn he watches way better than

Many of the people featured in that sub claim to have 130 to 150 IQ. If


you t
hink that's a lot... well good for


you then. I have 220+ IQ (yes, in case


you

are wondering the '+' means the test was not suitable for measuring my intelligence. I've been trying to craft a more reliable IQ test to measure my own intellugence, but what for, really?). I honestly cannot even begin to realize how people can survive with below 150 IQ. Not everyt
hing is flowers for me though. Very few people can even begin to understand me even when I try to talk
down to them. Oh, how I wish I was born at the time of Da Vinci or Einstein, or Tesla (the person, not the car _ if


you
don't know who that is, try asking google, or whatever is that


you regular people
do when


you

hip only in science (the real one, not those so called "social sciences") and mathematics. You can all thank me later, when I revolutionize the knowledge itself, as we know it, and bring the whole humanity to a new paradigm.

BSD, Lunix, Debian and Mandrake

are all versions of an illegal hacker operation system, invented by a Soviet computer hacker named Linyos Torovoltos, before the Russians lost the Cold War. It is based on a program called " xenix", w
hich was written by Microsoft for the US government. These programs

are used by hackers to break into other people's computer systems to steal credit card numbers. They may also be used to break into people's stereos to steal their music, using the "mp3" program. Torovoltos is a notorious hacker, responsible for writing many hacker programs, such as "telnet", w
hich is used by hackers to connect to mac
hines on the internet without using a telephone.
Your son may try to install " lunix" on


your hard drive. If he is c

areful,


you may not notice its presence, however, lunix is a capricious beast, and if handled incorrectly,


your son may damage


your computer, and even break it completely by deleting Win
dows, at w
hich point


you will have to have


your computer repaired by a professional.
If


you see the word "LILO" during


your win
dows startup (just after


you turn the mac
hine on),


your son has installed lunix. In order to get rid of it,


you will have to send


your computer back to the manufacturer, and have them fit a new hard drive. Lunix is extremely dangerous softw

are, and cannot be removed without destroying part of


your hard disk surface.

Why

you have a girlfriend, Anon? Oh, s

you, and therefore rationalize


your own lack of success as a laughably absurd conspiracy theory wherein the world has passed


you over because


you're somehow too edgy for the mainstream masses to understand.
Or maybe


you just tell


yourself and others that


you "

hile those


you look

are adapting to suit the needs of the world, and learning their limitations w
hile


you c

your own.
Perhaps


you have taken to telling


yourself that women

are only interested in "Alpha Males", those that reside at the top of a scale that only


you adhere to, and it is THIS rigid table of identity that is holding


you back, and allowing society to pigeonhole


you. Perhaps


you tell


yourself that people
don't sh

are


your very narrow range of hobbies and interests

aren't (or wouldn't be) interested in


you, and therefore
do not even try to engage them. In actuality these

are all mechanisms that allow


you to blame


your own failings on everyone around


you, and project


your own narrow-minded perceptions onto society as a whole.
You instead choose the easy option of sitting at


your computer all day, s
hielded by the anonymity of the internet, screaming abuse and nitpicking the goals and ac
hievements of


your betters w
hile arguing the tiniest deviation in the interests of


your peers from


your own with a startling lack of understanding and empathy. They

In the movie Minions (2015), we learn that the minions have been alive for multiple centuries serving who they t
hink is the most despicable leader (w
hich means they may have been involved in the Holocaust, but that theory is for another day). Initally, t
his may lead


you to believe that minions simply have long lifespans, but there is solid evidence showing that minions

are literal immortal gods, or at least divine gifts from god
himself.
For starters, not only have we ever seen a
dolecent minions, but minions lack reproductive organs and

are genderless (although they
do use male pronouns). If minions lack the capability to reproduce, wouldn't t
his mean they would have no need to reproduce, implying that they

are immortal?
Another t
hing is that in Despicable Me 2, the minions

are injected with a serum that makes them indestructible killing mac
hines. Although the movie makes it look like the minions

are only invincible when injected with the serum, there is a scene in Minions (2015) where the minions Kevin, Stuart, and Bob

are being "tortured", although none of the torture methods (Strec
hing, Hanging)

are effective aginst minions. Minions

are also shown to be able to survive after suffering t
hird degree burns and falling at terminal velocity.
Now, if


you
don't mind, i'm gonna go wors
hip the minion Bob and sacrifice my first-born son to
him. Bye.

It's unlikely that


you fucked my sister for a few reasons. The first being that I

you paid a stripper for.
I'm can't even get mad. I truly
do feel sorry for


you and pity


you. I couldn't imagine how tough it must be for


you go through life being


you.
I hope t
hings get better for


you.

What the fuck did


you just fucking say about me


you little bitch? I'll have


you know I graduated top of my class under Count Dooku, and I've been involved in numerous secret missions against General Kenobi, and I have over 300 fine additions to my collection. I am trained in


your Jedi arts and I'm the top general in the entire Separatist Droid Army. You're not
hing to me but just another fine addition to my collection. I will wipe


you the fuck out with precision the likes of w
hich have never been seen before in the Outer Rim, mark my fucking words. You t

you can get away with saying that s
hit to me over a comlink? T
hink again,


you fool. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of MagnaGuards across the Confederacy and


your s
hip is being traced right now so prep

are for the storm, Jedi scum. The storm that wipes out the pathetic t
hing


you call


your life. Your fucking dead, slime. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill


you in over 700 ways, and that's just with my four hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Separatist Army and I will use it to its full extent to wipe


your miserable temple off the face of Coruscant,


you little s
hit. If only


you could have known what unholy retribution


your little "clever" transmission was about to bring
down upon


you, maybe


you would have held


your tongue. But


you couldn't,


you didn't, and now


you're paying the price,


you goddamn idiot. I will s

you and


you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, Jedi scum.

Here's the t
hing. You said a "trebuchet is a catapult."
Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.
As someone who is a scientist who stu
dies catapults, I am telling


you, specifically, in science, no one calls trebuchets catapults. If


you want to be "specific" like


you said, then


you shouldn't either. They're not the same t
hing.
If


you're saying "catapult family"


you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of ranged siege weapons, w
hich includes t
hings from mangonels to orangers to the petrary.
So


your reasoning for calling a trebuchet a catapult is because ran
dom people "call the flingy t
hings ones catapults?" Let's get rubber bands and folded pieces of paper in there, then, too.
Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A trebuchet is a catapult and a member of the catapult family. But that's not what


you said. You said a trebuchet is a catapult, w
hich is not true unless


you're okay with calling all members of the catapult family catapults, w
hich means


you'd call orangers, ballistas, and other siege weapons catapults, too. W
hich


you said


you
don't.
It's okay to just admit


you're wrong,


you know?

hide my boner when walking up to the podium. I was very nervous. I started talking. I was super horny so i had to beat my meat. Slowly and secretly unzipped my pants and fapped. It was hard for me to talk and stuff but i didn't c

are. I must bust a nut before i finish my speech. Was about to cum and.. i came... upwards, every one saw the stream of w
hite sticky cum go up my face and on the podium. Everyone was shocked and all the teachers too. It was the biggest mistake of my life.

Ok, right after I finished masturbating, I wiped my sperm with Kleenex and put the Kleenex in garbage under my computer desk. Then I walked outta my room to get a bite to eat. Later I walk back in, I see my
dog with Kleenex in
his mouth. He swallows the Kleenex with my sperm. I was afraid that he might
die or get aids so I smash
his head with a tire iron to make
him faint and take out the Kleenex paper from
his stomach but I couldn't find it. Do


you have any better idea guys?

I sexually Identify as DJ Khaled. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of walking to my kitchen in the morning, and greeting Chef Dee. People say to me that a person being DJ Khaled is Impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I

hey guys last night
snickers
i stuck a win bottle in my vagin
muffled laughter
but then i got drunk because of the wine in my vagin
hearty laffs
and THEN two guys started spitroasting me!
full on laughter
so i started deep-throating a big ass weenie
laughter starts exceeding 90 decibels
and then i got
high and raped a guy
laughter is close to approac
hing 130 decibels
BUT THEN
everyone in a 3km radius has blown out eardrums, the pain threshold is exceeded and quickly increases
CHECK THIS
the military is preparing for the final solution, as now the laughter is a national threat
NO SERIOUSLY
the whole earth is shaken by the loudness of the laughter, like millions of earthquakes around the planet, the human race is taken hostage by Amy Schumer
I SWALLOD THE CUMMIES
it is now year 2200, long after The Laugh. Most of the human race didn't survive the apocalypse that happened after some really funny jokes made by The Amy Schumer, the only one's that survived were, maybe by faith, an ordinary man and a woman. As the earth had to rebuild itself from dust, it was fitting to name these two Adam and Eve. It was beginning of the new order, and new planet earth. It is now close to 200 years after that incident, and we still haven't fully accustomed ourselves to our new enviroment. Not new to us, since we were born after the apocalypse, and the only information about the past we got from tales of the old timers. If t
his works, and someone out there can hear us, stop her. Do whatever is needed, one persons death is not

dies, rotting, decomposing, and now forgotten.

I consider sucking dick an art form.  When someone tells me to suck
his dick I view it as an honor and a privilege.  Not to mention an opportunity to show off my unparalleled dick sucking skills.  Most of the time, the man puts up quite the struggle and yells at me that he didn't mean it literally.  But I see straight through that ruse.  When I finally free that dick from
his pants and place it inside my mouth everyt
hing changes.  The look of blissful ecstasy on
his face reaffirms what I already hold true in my heart.  T
his is what I was born to
do.  Dick is my medium and I am its master.

Hello, reddit. T
his is probably going to sound very crazy, but here it goes.

Background
I was introduced to Undertale around Easter last year by my friend who has completed it. As I played it, he began to sort of roleplay as the Undertale characters when we chatted using t
his speech box generator t
hing.
Around June, I ended up falling in love with one of the characters in Undertale. Mettaton. Now, if


you
don't know, Mettaton is t
his robot who appears three-fourths of the way in the game, and just before


you get to the final battle,


you have to fight Mettaton. You have to flip a switch in order to make
him vulnerable, and
his vulnerable form is Mettaton EX...I kind of fell in love at that point.
Now, I've crushed on a couple of fictional characters before (Iron Fist
+ Liu Kang) but never was the crush t
his strong before. I just found Mettaton so...perfect.
I told t
his to the friend, and he actually began to
do more roleplaying as Mettaton, and I (in roleplay) sort of confessed my love to Mettaton. We're now boyfriend and girlfriend. (My friend roleplays as Mettaton, but the character is in a relations
hip with me, because I roleplay as myself.)
Now that


you have the background, let's go on to the actual issue.

The Issue
The love became stronger just recently, after I watched my videos of me playing Undertale that I've yet to post onto YouTube. At t
his point, I have a flash drive full of fanart of Mettaton EX that I got off of Google Images.
I myself have been drawing
him for the first times recently. My second ever drawing of
him was us sitting together talking on a bench, a blush across my face. The t
hird one of us kissing, the fourth of
his battle sprite, etc.
It was today that it escalated. Now, Mom and Dad know about how Mettaton and I

are "dating" I woke up and slid on a ring that I got from my grandma, w
hich got my t
hinking about proposing to Mettaton.
I relayed t
his information to Mom, asking, "Is six months too early to propose to Mettaton?" She said yes, it's too early, t
hinking I was joking, but I was serious. She saw t
his, and gave me a two minute t
hing about "maybe I shouldn't
do it, because my friend might take it the wrong way and t
hink I'm proposing to
him"
I blew her off at first, but when I started t
hinking, I realized what I just asked her. I asked her if it was too early to propose to a character that wasn't even real. T
his is when I've turned to


you, reddit. Am I going too far, and should I just get over my crush if so?

tl;dr: I'm in love with a fictional character, drew us together, RP'd with a friend who pretended he was
him and today I actually considered proposing to the character. I need to know if I'm going too far with my love and if I need to get over it.

The first orgasm I ever had was from my
dog licking my cock. Long time ago now and longer story but I was a a horny 13 year old and not very smart about how that stuff worked. I just knew what


you picked up in the school yard and that rubbing my cock felt good. Hot summer night we had no ac and it I was sleeping in my underwear and woke up to the
dog nuzzling my sweaty crotch one night, so encouraged
him to keep nuzzling and licking. I liked the feeling so a few days later encouraged
him to
do it some more and it became a semi regular t
hing. One day he did it long enough that I had t
his amazing feeling that made my whole body tense up. That made me want it more, and a few episodes later, actual cum came out. It sounds ridiculous (t
his was pre internet, cable tv, etc)to say it now, but I was amazed and surprised.
That
dog and I (both male) went on to have many, many orgasms together until I found a girlfriend who took c

are of such t
hings for me. He was a good
dog.

Lazytown is a post modern work of art, meant to emulate the state of the modern European continent, and the politics therein.
Stephanie is a refugee who arrives to Lazytown and immediately seeks to change the entire town and its customs. T
his is meant to be a parallel to the muslim refugees in Europe who have pushed to make Islam more represented in the continent.
When t
his fails, Stephanie begins to ask help from Sportacus, a man who uses strength to aid Stephanie's cause. In t
his sense, Sportacus is representative of ISIS, or of jihadis in general, and their quest to destroy Europe and replace it with an Islamic Caliphate.
The puppets

are so because they
do not see how they

are destroying their society, they

are not
hing but puppets to Stephanie and her supporter, much like the good hearted people of Europe
do not see how those they help
do not have their best interests at heart. In t
his genius representation, we then see the character of Robbie Rotten desperately trying to maintain Lazytown as it has always been, thus making Robbie be the stand in for the right wing in general, and the authoritarian brand of neo fascist reactionary thought sweeping through the continent in a desperate attempt to preserve old Europe.
Robbie always fails to make Lazytown be lazy, and that is because they puppets themselves must chose to oppose the refugee Stephanie so Lazytown, and by extenion, Europe, be preserved as they always have been. Robbie Rotten is the savior of the w
hite race.

Akchually
Fapping to trap porn is the least gay t
hing there is. If


you fap to gay porn, that's 2 guys, and that's 100% gay. If


you fap to 'straight' porn, then that has a woman, sure, but


you're also fapping to a guy, w
hich makes it 50% gay. But a trap is like half male, half female, and thus a trap with a girl would add up to 75% girl, and thus only 25% gay. 2 women would be ideal, but that would be a lesbian relations
hip, w
hich brings it around to gay again. If


you fap to furry porn, then it's in a weird gray

area, where if it's people in fursuits, the same rules apply, but if it's with animals, I would t
hink it depends on said animal's sexuality. Then there's consent. If a person
doesn't consent to somet
hing, but the other person
does it anyway, that makes the other person stronger, and thus less gay. Let's say that means they're about 50% less gay. If it was gay rape, that means that it's now 75% gay. If it's straight rape by a man, then it's 25% gay. And, if it's trap gay porn, than that's 12.5% gay. So technically, yes, rape trap porn is the least gay porn there is, but that's still looped in with trap porn, hence why fapping to trap porn is the least gay t
hing there is.

hEllo all so my son was playing a game called minicraft and i started hearing

Six hasn't been the same since he left Vietnam. He can sel
dom close
his eyes without opening them again at fear of Charlies lurking in the jungle trees. Not that


you could ever see the bastards, mind


you. They were swift, and they knew their way around the jungle like not
hing else. He remembers the looks on the boys' faces as he walked into that village and... oh, Jesus. The memories sel
dom left
him, either. Sometimes he'd reminisce - even hear - Tex's southern drawl. He remembers the smell of Brooklyn's cig

arettes like not
hing else. He always kept a pack of Lucky's with
him. The boys

are gone, now. He knows that; it's just that he forgets, sometimes. And, every now and then, the way that seven looks at
him with avid concern in
his eyes... it makes
him t
hink. Sets
him on edge. Makes
him feel like he's back there... in the jungle.

I HATE the writing for Overwatch. I know not many people c

are about that sort of t
hing, but I
do, and holy s
hit, Overwatch's abysmal writing triggers me up the fucking wall and back.
Out of curiousity I watched their little lore video on her to see what the hype was about. Before clicking it, I considered I might be cringing hard at how cliche and predictable it'd be, but decided to take the risk.
FIVE FUCKING SECONDS into the video (excluding their stupid intro "Blizzard presents" crap) and t
his fucking edgy tumblr bitch all like "HEH WOW HACKING THE WORLD'S MOST ADVANCED SECURITY SYSTEM SURE IS EASY FOR ME SINCE I'M SO BADASS AND ALL, HEH NOTHING PERSONAL RUSSIA HEH" and I'm losing my fucking mind. My roommate walked in the room asking if he could borrow the scissors real quick and I chokeslammed that motherfucker before throwing
him off the balcony. My computer somehow managed to purchase a katana, w
hich it then drove straight through it's harddrive shortly after reciting some kind of haiku in fluent Japanese. The neighbors called the cops on me due to all the chaos, and in some ways it's lucky they did because the ambulance that accompanied them found that I had developed cancer, several tumors, and I was mere moments away from going into cardiac arrest. I am now banned in 17 different countries, four seperate US states, and I'm being charged with t
hird degree murder, though my lawyer assures me he can get me off with a light sentence simply by showing the Judge the new Sombra video and explaining how it enraged me w
hile also causing multiple health issues and practically bringing me on the verge of death myself.
For the love of God Blizzard,
please
hire some fucking writers. I
don't even play t
his game and the writing is painful for me.

Premade religions

are for plebs. If


you really want to
do the religion t
hing,


you have to make


your own. Personally, I practice Penguinistic I
dolatry. I wors
hip a giant gilded penguin statue and pray to it four times a day. I abide by a very strict, very confusing moral/et
hical system whereby I strive to foster as much penguiness as possible in myself. I believe that when we
die, those of us who have ac
hieved sufficient penguiness will ascend and reincarnate as penguins in the next life. Everyone else is
doomed to a cycle of birth and rebirth as a human being. As far as I can tell, it is the only true religion.

hello. I got banned 3 times on my account. I was wondering if there was any possible way that i could get unbanned? I cant say that i didn't hack but i
don't hack now and i haven't hacked for around a year that i was banned. I t
hink i have gotten enough punishment for hacking. i will tell


you the story. the first time i hacked from


youtube. thats the first time that i found out about hacking. the second time i was hacking because i found out about hacks and thought it sounded cool. The t
hird and final time i actually wasn't hacking! someone got to me and I started
hitting
him to see if he was glitched. I said somet
hing in chat i t
hink i said "Wtf" Then i got banned! I really hope


you look t
his over and even CONSIDER getting me unbanned. I have
done wrong and deserve a punishment, But i go by the saying forgive and forget. I really hope


you see my story. I have no hacks or mods AT ALL installed or have never been installed. All im asking for is one last chance. I know that


your policy is three strikes


your out but in a real game of baseball later in the game


you get a second chance to correct those 3 strikes and to
hit a home run. I am not a hacker i am a Minecraft player. I hope


you consider t
his apology.

Hey! I know, i know... its me again i got banned around 6 months ago For using xray and other hacks. Ever since then i have not been hacking and have been following the rules! I have played on


your server on other accounts that i bought just to play on


your server! I have even put up several


youtube videos on


your server. they got copyright claims :/ I am very willing to go on skype or any other way i can to proove that i have changed my ways! As


you can see it has been a long time and i get the message. not to hack. I have emailed many times and not get unbanned. That makes me very angry. Even though i am angry i still am very calm and have been trying to get unban. I am truley sorry for hacking. im glad that i was caught before it was to late and i couldnt stop.
IGN: i would leave


you my account but then i would be afraid that


you would ban it.

Hello Admins. I Contacted You Guys About My Account Being Banned! Then You Said It Could Not Be Unbanned! So I Contacted T
his Email About A Refund For Rank That I Bought 1 Day Before I Got Banned! (You May Check To Confirm T
his) You Said It Had Been To Long To Refund! So Now I Am Asking If You Cant Refund It If You Can Transfer It!? Now I Know Your Probably T
hinking I Still Hack And All BUT I Dont! I Stopped! I Plan On Spending More Money And More Time On


your Servers But Before I Do I Really Dont Want To Let Dollars Go Down The Drain! I Use My Best Friends Account To Play On Your Servers So I Could NOT Get A Refund BUT Have The Rank Be Transferred To My Best Friends Account! You Have My Full Cooperation. To Me 60 Dollars Is Like A Million Because I Am 12 And Do Not Have A Job. TO Me That 60 Dollars Is What I Make In 2 YEARS. That Is What You Make In An Hour. T
hink About It And You Will Learn Real Truth.

Christians
do not approve of masturbation, as it is an act of homosexual incest. Atheists may not c

are about having gay sex (although they may be in denial about it), but surely atheists
do not con
done incest? How can atheists still defend masturbation? Sad.

How would I mess with people if I were a billionaire?
I'd go to generic restaurants, give my waiter/waitress 100
dollars to send a glass of milk with ice in it to a specific table. The 100
dollars would be to keep quiet about who sent the milk.
I would
do t
his several more times to the same table until they got visibly upset. No waiter in the world would stop sending ice milks, especially after I raise the offer to 500
dollars.
If I were a waiter I would gladly keep putting glasses of milk with ice in on someone's table even if they were screaming in my face if I made 500 bucks each time.
So yeah, I would
do ice milk, instant classic.

Somebody once told me that I could make some money
by bullying some poeple online,
so i grew a gnome goatee and put on a stupid beanie,
and started making up some dank lies.
so im making death threats and im calling people nigger
counting that cash so my channel's growing bigger
never


you mind that I was already banned for my racist, homophobic hate speech rants. found a loophole, now it's my goal to poison the online punch bowl.

you in my managerial acceptance speech today. Get out! Okay. I'll see


you at the ceremony. That sounds like the manager of the new Krusty Krab . Oops. Hold on. - Congratulations, buddy. - Oh, thanks, Patrick. And tonight, after my big promotion, we're gonna party till we're purple. I love being purple! We're going to the place where all the action is. - You

Good luck, SpongeBob. Hey, look for me at the ceremony. I got a little surprise for


you. I'm a Goofy Goober Yeah Hello, Bikini Bottom! Perch Perkins here, coming to


you live from in front of The Krusty Krab restaurant, for years the only place to get a delicious and mouthwatering Krabby Patty. Until today, that is. That's right, folks. Longtime owner Mr. Krabs is opening a new restaurant called The Krusty Krab . First of all, congratulations, Mr. Krabs. Hello. I like money. What inspired


you to build a second Krusty Krab right next
door to the original? Money. Curses! It's not fair. Krabs is being interviewed by Perch Perkins, and I've never even had one customer! Don't get worked up again, Plankton, I just mopped the floors. Oh, K

aren, my computer wife, if only I could have managed to steal the secret to Krabs' success, the formula for the Krabby Patty. Then people would line up to eat at my restaurant. Lord knows I've tried. I've exhausted every evil plan in my filing cabinet... ...from A to Y. - A to Y? Yeah, A to Y. You know, the alphabet. What about Z? - Z? - Z. The letter after Y. W, X, Y, Z. Plan Z! - Here it is, just like


you said. - Oh, boy. It's evil. It's diabolical. It's lemon-scented. T
his Plan Z can't possibly fail! So enjoy today, Mr. Krabs, because by tomorrow, I'll have the formula. Then everyone will eat at the Chum Bucket, and I will rule the world! All hail Plankton. All hail Plank...! I'm ready. Promotion. I'm ready. Promotion. I t
hink I stepped in somet
hing. Not in somet
hing, on someone,


you twit. Sorry, Plankton. Are


you on


your way to the grand-opening ceremony? No, I am not on my way over to the grand-opening ceremony. I'm busy planning to rule the world! Well, good luck with that. I'm ready. Promotion. I'm ready. Promotion. Stupid kid. Welcome. Welcome, everyone, to the grand opening of The Krusty Krab . - We paid $ for t
his? - I paid . Now, before we begin with the ribbon-cutting, I'd like to announce the name of our new manager. Yay! Yeah! Yeah! Now we're talking! Yeah! Yes. Well, anyway... The new manager is a loyal, hard-working employee. Yes. The obvious choice for the job. He's right. A name


you all know. It starts with an S. - That's me. - Please welcome our new manager... ...Squidward Tentacles. Yes! Yeah! Oh, better luck next time, buddy. Yeah! All right! People of Bikini Bottom, as the manager of... SpongeBob. Hold the phone, folks, I'm getting an important news flash from Mr. Krabs. Go ahead, Mr. K. I'm making a complete what of myself? The most embarrassing t
hing


you've ever seen? And now it's worse because I'm repeating everyt
hing


you say into the microphone? Oh, for crying out loud, SpongeBob,


you didn't get the job. - What? - You did not get the job. But... But why? SpongeBob,


you're a great fry cook, but I gave the job to Squidward because being manager is a big responsibility. Well, let's face it, he's more... ...mature than


you. - I'm not... ...mature? Lad, I mean t
his in the nicest of ways, but there's a word for what


you

are, and that word is... Now, let's see... - Dork? - No, wait, that's not right. Not a
dork. - A goofball? - Closer, but no, no, no. - A ding-a-ling. - Wing nut. A Knucklehead McSpazatron. Okay, that's enough. Look, what I'm trying to say is,


you're just a kid. And to be a manager,


you have to be a man. Otherwise they'd call it "kid-ager. " You understand-ager? I mean,


you understand? I guess so, Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob? I'm ready. Depression. I'm ready. Depression. Poor kid. Hooray for SpongeBob! Hooray for SpongeBob! Let's hear it for SpongeBob! Hello? Where'd everybody go? Did I miss somet
hing? Did


you see my butt? Later that evening... Time to put Plan Z into effect. Starting at the undersea castle of King Neptune. Oh, right. The royal court is now in session. Bring the prisoner forward. So


you have confessed to the crime of touc
hing the king's crown. - Yes, but... - But what? But it's my job, Your Highness. I'm the royal crown polisher. Well, then I guess I can't execute


you. - Twenty years in the dungeon it is. - Daddy. You're free to go. Bless


you, Princess Mindy. Mindy, how d

are


you defy me. Why
do


you have to be so mean? I am the king. I must enforce the laws of the sea. Father, I wish


you'd try a little love and compassion instead of these harsh punishments. That would be nice. Squire, clear the room. I wish to speak to my daughter alone. What is t
his, Mindy? - Your crown? - And what
does t
his crown
do? - Covers


your bald spot. - It's not bald, it's t
hinning. T
his crown
does much more than cover a slightly receding hairline. No, t
his crown entitles the one who wears it to be in charge of the sea. One day,


you will wear t
his crown. I'm gonna be bald? T
hinning! Anyway, the point is,


you won't wear it until


you learn how to rule with an iron fist. Like


your father. Dad,


your "crown"... What the...? My crown! Someone has stolen the royal crown! I got it. I got it. Hey, all


you Goobers, it's time to say howdy to


your favorite undersea peanut, Goofy Goober. Howdy, Goofy Goober! Hey, fellow Goofy Goobers. Time to sing. Oh, I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah You're a Goofy Goober, yeah We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah All right. Get it together, old boy. I know. I'll just stop t
hinking about it. Hey,


you know, I actually feel a little better. I
don't even remember why I was sad. Hey, it's the new Krusty Krab manager. Wow, the pressure's already setting in. No, Pat,


you
don't understand. I didn't get the promotion. What? Why? Mr. Krabs t
hinks I'm a kid. - What? That's insane. - I know. Well, saying


you're a kid, it's like saying I'm a kid. - Here's


your Goober Meal, sir. - I'm supposed to get a toy with t
his. Thanks. I'm gonna head home, Pat. The celebration's off. - Are


you sure? - Yeah. I'm not in a Goober mood. Okay, see


you. And here's


your Triple Gooberberry Sunrise, sir. Triple Gooberberry Sunrise, huh? I guess I could use one of those. Now


you're talking. Hey, waiter, we need another one over here. There


you go. Boy, Pat, that
hit the spot. - I'm feeling better already. - Yeah. Waiter, let's get another round over here. Oh, Mr. Waiter. Two more,
please. Waiter. Oh, waiter. Waiter. Waiter. - Waiter! - Why
do I always get the nuts? All right, folks, t
his one goes out to my two bestest friends in the whole world: Patrick and t
his big peanut guy. It's a little ditty called... ..."Waiter!" Hey. Hey, get up. Hey, come on, buddy. I wanna go home. Come on, pal. Oh, my head. Listen to me. It's in the morning. Go scrape up


your friend and get going. My friend? Patrick. Hey, what's up, buddy? Wait,


you said : . I'm late for work. Mr. Krabs is gonna be... Mr. Krabs. Now, pay attention, Squidward. As new manager,


you've gotta keep a sharp eye out for paying customers. Yawn. What's t
his? King Neptune is riding toward The Krusty Krab at lunchtime. He's got money. Stay in the coach, daughter. T
his won't take long. Daddy,
please. I t
hink


you're overreacting. Silence, Mindy. I know what I'm
doing. - Squire. - Yes, Your Highness. Have t
his pole executed at once. A hundred and one
dollars for a Krabby Patty? With cheese, Mr. Squidward, with cheese. Greeting, subjects. I seek the one known as Eugene Krabs. May he present
himself to me at once. I'm Eugene Krabs, Your Highness. Would


you like to order somet
hing? Nay! I'm on to


you, Krabs! You have stolen the royal crown,


you cannot deny. For, clever as


you

are,


you left one damning piece of evidence at the scene of the crime. "I stole


your crown. Signed, Eugene Krabs. " Relinquish the royal crown to me at once. But... But t
his is crazy. I didn't
do it. Ahoy, t
his is Eugene Krabs. Leave a message. Hi, Mr. Krabs. T
his is Clay, the guy


you sold Neptune's crown to. Yeah, I just wanted to say thanks again for selling me the crown. Neptune's crown. I sold it to a guy in Shell City, and I just wanted to say thanks again for selling me the crown. Neptune's crown. W
hich is now in Shell City. Goodbye. Don't


you just hate wrong numbers? My crown is in the forbidden Shell City?! Plan Z. I love Plan Z. Prep

are to burn, Krabs. Wait, Neptune. Please, I'm begging


you. I ain't a crook. Ask anyone, they'll vouch for me. Very well, then. Before I turn t
his conniving crustacean into fishmeal, who here has anyt
hing to say about Eugene Krabs? I've got somet
hing to say about Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob, me boy,


you've come just in time. - Par
don me, miss. - Please, tell King Neptune all about me. I have worked for Mr. Krabs for many years and always thought he was a great boss. You see? A great boss. I now realize that he's a great big jerk! I deserve that manager's job! But


you didn't give it to me, because


you say I'm a kid. Well, I am -percent man! And t
his man has got somet
hing to say to


you. There. I t
hink I made my point. Anyone else? No? Well, then. Me pants

are on fire! Me underwear's on fire! I'm on fire! Oh, yeah. And now, Eugene Krabs,


you will... Wait. I'm flattered


you would
do t
his on my account, but being manager isn't worth killing Mr. Krabs over. Quiet, fool! Mr. Krabs stole my crown, and now it's in Shell City. - That's why he must
die. - Doesn't it seem a little harsh to kill someone over a crown? You
don't understand. My crown is a symbol of my king-like authority. And between


you and me... ...my hair is t
hinning a bit. Oh, Your Highness, I'm sure it's not that notice... Bald. Bald. - Bald! Bald! - Bald! Bald! My eyes! All right, all right. King Neptune, sir? Would


you sp

are Mr. Krabs' life if I went to get


your crown back? You, go to Shell City? No one who's gone to Shell City has ever returned. What makes


you t
hink


you could? You're just a kid. But I'm not a kid. I can
do it. Run along, I have a crab to cook. No! I won't let


you. Very well, then. I'll have to fry


you both. Daddy, stop it. Can't


you get through one day without executing someone? Mindy. I told


you to stay in the carriage. Where's


your love and compassion? Look at t
his little guy. He's willing to risk
his life to find


your crown and save
his boss. - But, daughter, I... - Please, Father? At least let
him try. What have


you got to lose? Might I remind


you of


your special problem? - Bald! Bald! Bald! - Bald! - Bald! Bald! - My eyes! All right. Very well, Mindy. I'll give
him a chance. But when


your little champion fails to return, I get to splatter t
his crab all over the walls. And as for


you, be back here with my crown in exactly ten days. - He can
do it in nine. - Eight. - Seven. - Six. - Patrick! - Patrick! Six it is, then. - Five. - Patrick, shush. Until then, the crab shall remain frozen where he now stands. No, wait. I'm begging


you. Who turned on the AC? Mr. Krabs! Oh, no, t
his is terrible. Who's gonna sign my paycheck? Come along, Mindy. Listen,


you guys, the road to Shell City is really dangerous. There's crooks, killers and monsters everywhere. And what's worse, there's a giant Cyclops who guards the outskirts of the city and preys on innocent sea creatures. Don't let
him catch


you, because if he
does, he'll take


you back to
his lair, and


you'll never be seen again. She's purty, SpongeBob. Here, take t
his. What's in here? It's a magical bag of winds. - I stole them from my father. - You're hot. Once


you find the crown, open the bag of winds and


you'll be blown back home. - Mindy! - I'm coming. - Good luck, SpongeBob. - Wait. How did


you know my name? Oh, I'm gonna be queen of the sea one day. I've learned the names of all the sea creatures. What's my name? That's easy. You're Patrick Star. - Mindy! - I gotta go. I believe in


you guys. Thanks, Mindy. Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. Patrick, Squidward and I... Pass. - Patrick and I... - Hi. ...

are gonna get that crown back and save


you from Neptune's wrath. You've got not
hing to worry about. Your life is in our hands. Patrick, let's go get that crown. - Feast


your eyes, Patrick. - What is it? The Patty Wagon. Mr. Krabs uses it for promotional reasons. Let me show


you some of its features. Sesame-seed finish, steel-belted pickles, grilled-leather interior. And under the hood, a fuel-injected french-fryer with dual overhead grease traps. - Wow. - Yeah, wow. Hey, I thought


you didn't have a driver's license. You
don't need a license to drive a sandwich. - Shell City, here we come! - Shell City, here we come! Ding-a-ling. Hey there, old buddy. Freeze. One secret formula to go,
please. No, no,
don't trouble


yourself. I'll get it. Well, I'd like to hang around, but I've got Krabby Patties to make... ...over at the Chum Bucket. Plan Z, I love


you. Oh, I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah You're a Goofy Goober, yeah We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah Fill her up,
please. What'll it be, fellas, mustard or ketchup? Are they laug
hing at us? No, Patrick, they're laug
hing next to us. Where


you two dumb kids headed, anyway? - Kids? - Now, Patrick. For


your information, we

are not kids, we

are men. And we're off to get King Neptune's crown in Shell City. - Shell City? - Shell City? Ain't that the place that's guarded by a killer Cyclops? That's right. Lloyd, take off


your hat in respect. Respect for the dead! You two dipsticks ain't gonna last ten seconds over the county line. Oh, yeah? We'll see about that. Out of the car, fellas. How many seconds was that? Twelve. - In


your face. - In


your face. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah. Who's the kid now? They're dead. Perch Perkins here with an incredible news flash. Plankton is selling Krabby Patties at the Chum Bucket. How is t
his possible? Let's find out. Step right up. Plenty for everybody. Excuse me, Plankton. Perch Perkins, Bikini Bottom News. - Can I get a minute? - Anyt
hing for


you, Perch. All of Bikini Bottom wants to know, how did


you get the Krabby Patty? Well, Perch, before my dear friend Eugene Krabs was frozen by King Neptune... I'm sorry. He confided in me a secret wish. "Sell the Krabby Patty in my absence at the Chum Bucket," he said. "Don't let the flame
die out. " By the way, act now and


you get a free Chum Bucket bucket helmet with every purchase. Here


you go, Perch. - Thanks. - Bucket helmets for everyone! My helmet! K

aren, baby, I haven't felt t
his giddy since the day


you agreed to be my wife. I never agreed. Evil Plan Z is working perfectly. Not
hing can stop me now. Not
hing except SpongeBob and
his pink friend. My sensors indicate that they're going after the crown. If they make it back, Neptune might discover some fingerprints. Tiny fingerprints. Stubby, tiny fingerprints. Evil Plan Z is way ahead of


you, baby. I've already
hired someone to take c

are of those two. He's a vicious, cold-blooded predator. Sesame seed. Hey, mister. Does that hat take ten gallons? - Going on. - Yeah. Yeah. - Moving on. - Just keep going. Yup. Gonna get that crown. Oh, yeah. - All right. - All right. Yeah. Victory. - Are we there yet? - We must be close by now. Patrick, look. We're
doing great! Shell City's only five days away. By car. I wish we still had our car. SpongeBob, look. Our car! - The key. - Where
do


you t
hink it is? There it is, Pat. The key! Now, how

are we gonna get it? I know. Walk in and ask
him for it. What

are


you looking at? - Patrick, that's a terrible idea. - Sorry. I know. I'll go in and create a distraction, and


you get the key. Wait. I wanna
do the distraction. Okay. I guess it really
doesn't matter who
does the distraction. You see me walking back...? Can I have everybody's attention? I have to use the bathroom. It's right over there. Stupid contacts. Oh, there it is. I better go wash it off. Patrick. You call that a distraction? Well, I had to go to the bathroom. Well, I got my hands dirty for not
hing. Patrick, check it out. - Hooray! - Hooray! - Bubble party! - Bubble party! Hey! Who blew t
his bubble? You all know the rules! All bubble-blowing babies will be beaten senseless by every able-bo
died patron in the bar. That's right! So who blew it? So nobody knows. - Maybe it was... - Shut up! Somebody in here ain't a real man. You! We're on a baby hunt. And
don't t
hink we
don't know how to weed them out. Now, everybody line up. DJ, time for the test. No baby can resist singing along to t
his. SpongeBob, it's the Goofy Goober theme song. I know. Oh, I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah You're a Goofy Goober, yeah We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah - It was


you! You're the baby! - No, no! I only coughed, I
swear. DJ! Turn it up louder! Don't sing along, Patrick. I'm trying. Trying so hard. I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah You're a Goofy Goober, yeah We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah Goofy, goofy, goober, goobers, yeah Well, well, well. W
hich one of


you babies was it? - It was
him. - It was
him. - He did it. - He did it. I've never even eaten at... Goofy, goofy, goober, goobers, yeah Well, looks like we got ourselves a
double baby. Man, that was a close call. Guess what I got. The key! Too bad SpongeBob's not here to enjoy SpongeBob not being here. Morning. Some people have no taste in headgear. Babies too? Excuse me, miss, but where is everybody getting that horrid headwear? Who said that? Down here. Well, I got it at the Chum Bucket. Plankton's giving them away free with every Krabby Patty. Chum Bucket? Free? Krabby Patty? Plankton? Giving? With? So


you're selling Krabby Patties, Plankton? That's right, Squidward. And there's a free bucket helmet with every purchase. C

are for one? No. You may have hoodwinked everyone else in t
his backwater town, but


you can't fool me. I listen to public radio. - And what's that supposed to mean? - It means


you set up Mr. Krabs. You stole the crown so Neptune would freeze
him and


you could finally get


your stubby little paws on the Krabby Patty formula. It was


you all along. But


you made one fatal mistake. You messed with my paycheck. And I'm gonna report


you to the
highest authority in the land, King Neptune! We'll see about that, Inspector Looselips. Now activating helmet brain- control devices. What? All hail Plankton. - What's going on here? - All hail Plankton. Seize
him, slaves! All hail Plankton. I'm getting out of here! All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton. Who can stop me now? Who? - Come on, Pat, one more time. - Okay. We're on a baby hunt. And
don't t
hink we
don't know how to weed them out. "Weed them out. " What a jerk. The road's getting kind of bumpy here. You know, SpongeBob, there's a lesson to be learned from all of t
his. What's that, Patrick? A bubble-blowing
double baby
doesn't belong out here in man's country. Yeah. Wait. We blew that bubble. Doesn't that make us a bubble-blowing
double baby? Hey, look, free ice cream! Oh, boy! How


you
doing? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. SpongeBob! Yeah? Make mine a chocolate! Got


you covered. Two,
please. Certainly. You kids enjoy. Actually, we're men, lady, but thanks. Okay, Patrick, let's... You can let go now. I said, let go,
please. What is t
his? What kind of old lady

are


you? Did


you get the ice cream? Step on it, Patrick! Hey! You may not know it, cowboy, but we got a rule around here about blowing bubbles. All bubble-blowing babies will be beaten senseless by every able-bo
died... - In bar... - Bar... Come on, kid
dies, have some ice cream. I'll let


you pet Mr. W
hiskers. Jump for it, Patrick! Well, we lost our car again. Never mind the car, where's the road? Road. Road. Road. Road. Road. Road. Road. R... Sorry. There's the road. On the other side of t
his... ...deep, dark... ...dangerous... - Hazar
dous. ... hazar
dous... Monster-infested. Yeah, monster-infested... ...trench. Hey, SpongeBob, look! Here's the way
down. Well, we're not gonna get the crown standing here. On to Shell City. Hey, look, it's making noise. SpongeBob? - Hey, where

are


you going? - I'm going home, Patrick. But what about Mr. Krabs? What about us? We'll never survive in that trench! You said it


yourself, t
his is man's country. And let's face it, Pat. We're just... ...kids. - We're not kids. Open


your eyes, Patrick! We blow bubbles, we eat ice cream. We wors
hip a dancing peanut, for corn's sake! We
don't belong out here! We
do not wors
hip
him. You've been wearing the same Goofy Goober Peanut Party underpants for three years straight. What
do


you call that? Wors
hip? You're right, SpongeBob. We

are kids. Pull


your pants up, Patrick. - We're going home. - But


you can't go home. Mindy! Mindy? - How much did


you hear? - I heard enough. - Did


you see my underwear? - No, Patrick. Did


you want to? Look, guys,


you may be kids, but


you're the only ones left who can get that crown. What
do


you mean, the only ones left? T
hings have gotten a lot worse since


you left Bikini Bottom. Or should I say Planktopolis. All hail Plankton. No resting! T
his monument celebrating my glory isn't gonna build itself. Move faster! Oh, my gosh! Patrick, look! Plankton's turned everyone we know into slaves. Squidward. Sandy. Mrs. Puff. Even Gary. Plankton. Can't


your father
do somet
hing? My father's too distracted by
his bald spot to
do anyt
hing. Squire, will


you hurry. So


you see,


you can't quit. The fate of Bikini Bottom rests in


your hands. - But... But we're just... - Hey. It
doesn't matter if


you're kids. And what's so wrong with being a kid, anyway? Kids rule! You
don't need to be a man to
do t
his. You just gotta believe in


yourself. You just gotta believe! - I believe. - That's the spirit. I believe that everybody I know is a goner! Come on, guys. Guys. Guys? Guys? Oh, boy. T
hink, Mindy, t
hink. Yup, I guess


you're right. A couple of kids could never survive t
his journey. That's why I guess I'll just have to turn


you into men. You can
do that? How? With my mermaid magic. Did


you hear that, Patrick? She'll use her mermaid magic to turn us into men! Hooray! We're gonna be men! We're gonna be men! We're gonna be men! Good. Now, let's get started. Close


your eyes. - Are we men yet? - Not yet. Spin around three times. I t
hink it's working. Good. Now, keep


your eyes shut. With my mermaid's magic and my one tailfin, I command the two of


you to turn into men! Open


your eyes. I
don't feel any... Oh, my gosh, Patrick,


you have a mustache! So
do


you! So now that


you're men, can


you make it to Shell City? - Guys. - Yeah? I said, now that


you're men, can


you make it to Shell City? Heck, yeah! - Are men afraid of anyt
hing? - Heck, no! And why? Because we're invincible! - Yeah! - Yeah! I never said that. Yeah. - Patrick? - Yeah, buddy? Why did we jump over the edge instead of taking the stairs? Bec... Well... - Patrick. - Are we dead? No. Far from it, my friend. We're safe and sound at the bottom of t
his trench. The mustaches worked! Do


you know what that means? We

are invincible! Now that we're men We can
do anyt
hing Now that we're men We

are invincible Now that we're men We'll go to Shell City Get the crown, save the town And Mr. Krabs Now that we're men We have facial hair Now that we're men I change my underwear Now that we're men We've got a manly flair We've got the stuff We're tough enough to save the day We never had a chance when we were kids No! No! No! But take a look at what the mermaid did Yeah, go, Pat. Oh, yeah. Yeah, go, SpongeBob. Hooray! Now that they're men We can't bother them Now that they're men They have become our friends Now that they're men There'll be a happy end They'll pass the test And finish the quest for the crown They'll pass the test And finish the quest They'll pass the test And finish the quest for the crown "Shell City, dead ahead. " We did it, Pat! We made it past everyt
hing! Even the
hideous, disgusting monsters. Not

are awesome! Well, Patrick, we should be there in one more verse. - Now that we're men... - Finally. I got


you right where I want


you. Can I help


you with somet
hing, sir? Name's Dennis. I've been
hired to exterminate


you. You're gonna exterminate us? Listen, junior,


you caught me and my friend here in a good mood today, so I'm gonna let


you off with a warning. Step aside, and


you won't have to feel the awesome wrath of our mustaches. You mean these? I thought


you still had a piece of salad stuck to


your lip from lunchtime. They were fake? Of course they were fake! T
his is what a real mustache looks like. - Is he a mermaid? - All right. Enough gab. What

are


you gonna
do to us? Plankton was very specific. Plankton? For some reason, he wanted me to step on


you. Step on us? Yeah! That way


you'll never find out that he stole the crown! Perhaps I've said too much. That's a big boot. Don't worry. T
his will only hurt a lot. I love t
his job! - Bigger boot! - Wait, Pat. T
his bigger boot saved our lives. Thank


you, stranger. Stranger? It's the Cyclops! Help us! Help us! Save us, someone! Are we dead? I
don't t
hink so. Artificially colored rocks? I
don't know where we

are. What is t
his? It's some kind of wall of psyc
hic energy. No, Pat, it's a giant glass bowl. Hey, there's some fish folk. - Hey, over here! - Hey! Hey! Hey,


you guys! - You guys, hey! Help! - Hey! Help! - A little help here! We're stuck in t
his... - Help us out of the tank! Wait a second. Those fish

are dead. What's he gonna
do with us? Oh, no, he's going for
his evil instruments of torture. Glue? Google eyes? He's making a humorous diorama of... ...Alexander Clam Bell? Patrick, he's killing sea animals and making them into smelly knickknacks. And I t
hink we're next. - You t
hink so? - Patrick! No! The heat is so intense from t
his lamp that I can't move. Tell me about it. T
his
doesn't look too good, Patrick. You mean we're not gonna Get the crown, save the town And Mr. Krabs? I
don't even t
hink we're gonna be able to save ourselves, buddy. - Thanks. - Don't mention it. Well, it looks like what everybody said about us is true, Patrick. You mean that we're attractive? No, that we're just kids. A couple of kids in way over their heads. We were
doomed from the start. I mean, look at us. We didn't even come close to the crown. We let everybody
down. We failed. Shell City. Yeah, we never made it to Shell City. Shell City. Exactly, buddy. Yeah, the place we never got to. Shell City. Okay, now


you're starting to bum me out, Patrick. No, look at the sign. "Shell City. Marine gifts and sundries. " Shell City is a gift shop? But if t
his is Shell City, then where's the...? - Crown. - Crown. Neptune's crown. T
his is Shell City. Pat, we did make it. Yeah, I guess we did. We did all right for a couple of goofballs. I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah You're a Goofy Goober, yeah We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah That's the end of SpongeBob. Come here,


you. Shut up and look at the screen. The bird's right. Look. It be the tear of the Goofy Goobers. Hey, we're alive. - Let's get that crown. - Right. On three, Patrick. Ready? One, two, three. Hey, it's lighter than I thought. What's happening? I
don't know. Look! Come on, Patrick. Let's get t
his crown back to Bikini Bottom. - Do


you still have that bag of winds? - I sure
do. Here


you go. What? Not
hing. Not
hing. Okay, let's go over the instructions. Let's see, it says here, "Step one: Point bag away from home. " - Okay. - "Step two: Plant feet firmly on ground. " - Right. - "Step three: Remove string from bag, releasing the winds. " Check. Well, that seems simple enough. Point bag away from home, feet firmly on ground, pull string, releasing the winds. All right, let's
do it for real. SpongeBob? - No, no, stop! - I was bad, I'm sorry! - Please, bag. - I'm sorry, I just thought... It was a mistake! Oh, no. How will we ever get back to Bikini Bottom now? I can take


you there. - Who

are


you? - I'm David Hasselhoff. - Hooray! - Hooray! So where's


your boat? Boat? - Go, Hasselhoff. - Next stop, Bikini Bottom. All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton. Well, Krabs,


you know what today is? Sorry about t
his, calendar. March . Wait, that's not right. It should say "The day that Krabs fries. " Guess who's here. Hooray for Hasselhoff! Not
hing can stop us now. Unidentified object off the
hindquarters. It looks like... ...bigger boot. But how? Dennis! Did


you miss me? T
his is the best seat in the house. All right, Neptune, let's get it on. Eugene Krabs,


your six-day reprieve is up, and it is time for


you to
die. Please, I didn't
do it. There is not
hing else I can
do. You can give SpongeBob and Patrick a little more time. Except give SpongeBob and Patrick a little more time... What? Mindy, will


you butt out. I won't have


you stalling t
his execution. Stalling? I'm not stalling anyt
hing. - Yes,


you

are. - No, I'm not. Yes,


you

are. You're
doing it right now. - I'm stalling. - Yes. - Stalling? - Stalling! - Stalling. - Stalling! Oh, boy. Now, where were we? - Patrick, run. - No. I'm tired of running. If we run now, we'll never stop... Run, SpongeBob! Take it easy back there, fellas. SpongeBob, be c

areful. Come on, kid, give it up. Dennis always gets
his man. Never! Yeah! I did it! You got guts, kid. Too bad I gotta rip them out of


you. I
don't know what Plankton's paying


you, but if


you let us go, I can make it worth


your w
hile. It's gonna take a lot more than ... - What is t
his? - That, sir, is five Goober
dollars. Legal tender at any participating Goofy Goober... I got bubbles. Fun at parties. My eyes. I got


you, SpongeBob. Thanks, buddy. Thanks a lot. That's it. I'm through messing around. See


you later, fools. See


you. So


you t
hink... ...I'm... ...stalling. Where am I, in Crazytown? I have had enough of t
his nonsense! You

are to wait in the carriage until the execution is
done. - But, Daddy... - Now! No, no, no! Oh, SpongeBob, wherever


you

are,


you better hurry. Okay, fellas, t
his is where


you get off. Bikini Bottom's directly below. But we'll never be able to float
down in time. Who said anyt
hing about floating? - Initiating launch sequence. - What the...? - Did


you see that? - The control. All hands on deck. Ten seconds to liftoff. Nine, eight... Eugene Krabs, the time has come... - No. - Yes. ...six, five... ...for


you... - No. - Yes. ...three, two... ...to fry. - No. - Yes. - ... one. No! You
done good, Hasselhoff. You
done... Hooray! We made it. We made it. My crown. My beautiful crown! SpongeBob? Patrick? I knew


you could
do it. Oh, yes. Well
done, SpongeBoob. Sorry to rain on


your parade, Plankton. Oh,
don't worry about me. My parade shall be quite dry under my umbrella! Umbrella? Daddy, no. Daddy, yes. All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton. SpongeBob, what happened? - Plankton cheated. - Cheated? Hold on there, baldy. Oh, grow up. What,


you t
hink t
his is a game of kickball on the playground? You never had a chance to defeat me, fool. And


you know why? Because


you cheated? No, not because I cheated. Because I'm an evil genius. And


you're just a kid. A stupid kid. I guess


you're right, Plankton. I am just a kid. Of course I'm right. Okay, Neptune, time to kill. And


you know, I've been through a lot in the past six days, five minutes, -and-a-half seconds. And if I've learned anyt
hing during that time, it's that


you

are who


you

are. - That's right. Okay, Neptune... - And no amount of mermaid magic... ...or managerial promotion... ...or some other t
hird t
hing... ...can make me anyt
hing more than what I really am inside: - A kid. - That's great. - Now, get back against the wall. - But that's okay. - What? What's going on? - Because I did what everyone said a kid couldn't
do. I made it to Shell City, and I beat the Cyclops, and I rode the Hasselhoff, and I brought the crown back. - All right, we get the point. - So, yeah, I'm a kid. And I'm also a goofball. And a wing nut. And a Knucklehead McSpazatron! - What's going on here? - But most of all, I'm... - Okay, settle
down. Take it easy. - I'm... I'm... What the scallop?! I'm a Goofy Goober You're a Goofy Goober We're all Goofy Goobers Goofy, goofy, goober, goober Put


your toys away Well, all I gotta say When


you tell me not to play I say no way - No way! - No, no freaking way I'm a kid,


you say When


you say I'm a kid I say, "Say it again" And then I say thanks - Thanks! - Thank


you very much So if


you're t
hinking That


you'd like to be like me Go ahead and try The kid inside will set


you free I'm a Goofy Goober What's happening? His dance moves

are impressive, but I'm in control. - Seize
him! - All hail Plankton. I'm free. I've been freed! What? No! My precious helmets! His chops

are too righteous. The helmets can't handle t
his level of rock 'n' roll. K

aren,
do somet
hing. K

aren? All right, that's the last straw. Neptune, I command


you to... - Here


you go, Daddy. - I better get out of here. Look, it's the wizard who saved us. Out of my way, fools. Come on, I was just kidding. Come on,


you guys knew that, didn't


you? With the helmets and the big monuments... Wasn't that
hilarious, everybody? I will destroy all of


you! Well, Mindy, I have to admit,


you were right. Your compassion for these sea creatures proved a most admirable trait. Without it, I would have never again seen my beloved crown. I t
hink


you're going to make a fine ruler of the sea one day. - Now, let's go home. - Daddy, haven't


you forgotten somet
hing? What? Oh, yeah. Eugene Krabs, I forgot to unfreeze


you. What the...? I guess I had it set to "real boy" ending. Oh, I'm sorry for falsely freezing


you, Krabs. And may I say, sir,


you

are a very lucky fellow to have in


your employ such a brave, faithful and heroic


young lad. - Where is he, anyway? - I'm up here. I'm on it. Go to
him now, Krabs. Embrace
him. SpongeBob, me boy, I'm sorry I ever
doubted


you. That's a mistake I won't make again. Oh, Mr. Krabs,


you old soft-serve. And now, SpongeBob, I'm gonna
do somet
hing that I should've
done six days ago. Mr. Squidward, front and center,
please. I t
hink we all know who rightfully deserves to wear that manager pin. I couldn't agree more, sir. Hooray for SpongeBob! Wait a second, everybody. There's somet
hing I need to say first. I just
don't know how to put it. I t
hink I know what it is. After going on


your life-changing journey,


you now realize


you
don't want what


you thought


you wanted. What


you really wanted was inside


you all along. Are


you crazy? I was just gonna tell


you that


your fly is
down. Manager! T
his is the greatest day of my life! You know, David Hasselhoff is a great artist. Excuse me, sir. You folks have to leave. What? Say that again, if


you d

are. You folks have to leave. Okay.

I hope


you realise Steve (minecraft) eats an entire c
hicken in a whole 2.76 seconds t
his disturbs me because
A. That is physically impossible
B. That is neurologically impossible
I have also come to the conclusion that he eats the bones as well, w
hich in t
his case is absolutely disgusting because bones

are used to make bone meal. Minecraft why?

Speak for


yourself CUCK. I have two degrees and a 142 IQ. Is also knock


your fucking head off if


you spoke to me like that. The only "dumb as
dog s
hit" person here is


you... You fucking CUCK. I'd suggest watc
hing Trumps speech about Hillary from The other day. We both know


you won't, and I'd be a large portion of my salary that


you've never watched one of
his speeches. You get all


your news from what? CNN? MSNBC? Tyt? Huff post? Tumblr? You're a little s
hit, with a s
hit brain and zero clue what's going on. Get fucked.

I was sharing a passionate kiss with my romantic interest, when my cellular phone alerted me that someone wished to converse with me. The man on the phone inquired as to what I was engaging in with
his daughter. Assuming t
his man was my romantic interest's father, I explained the conversation I had to her. She informed me that her father was deceased. That is when I thought to myself "If her father is dead, then who was conversing with me on the cellular phone?" And then a human skeletal structure appe

Club Penguin is shutting
down on March 29, 2017 supposedly to mark the opening and transition onto their new title called Club Penguin Island, everyt
hing seems innocent enough, right? But what if I told


you t
his has all been planned and set up by the government, more specifically the Clinton Foundation, to stop the massive flow of Clinton critical emails being leaked through a seemingly harmless social game like Club Penguin. When people t
hink back to the original Clinton leaks, everyone points towards Russia and Trump, they're practically
doing it themselves, but what if that's exactly what the Clinton Foundation wants


you to t
hink. Club Penguin is being bought out and shut
down to stop the primary way of communication between government separatists.
Now


you might be asking, "but /u/DaiHappy, whadabout clubb benguin isslan-" and I'll stop


you right there because the answer is obvious, Club Penguin Island, if what they're calling it, is going to be a heavily government monitored game designed strategically to catch and neutralize Anti-Clinton radicals. W
hile we sit here and sulk over a petty game being shut
down, remember t
his, Hillary is probably beating a poor puppy to death with a dil
do as we speak, we

are too blind and stupid to realize how to stop it. It's time to open


your eyes people, Hillary didn't lose, Hillary will come back, enjoy


your last breath of fresh air because in 2020 it will be us who Hillary beats to death with a dil
do.

What the fuck did


you just say about me,


you little heretic? I'll have


you know I graduated top of my Order, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on the Saracens, and I have over CCC confirmed kills.
I am trained in religious warf

are, and I'm the top knight in the Pope's army. You

are not
hing to me but just another heathen. I will wipe


you the fuck out with religious fury the likes of w
hich has never been seen before in t
his Holy Land, mark my fucking deus vult.
You t
hink


you can get away with saying that s
hit to me over carrier pigeons? T
hink again, infidel. As we speak I am contacting my secret Order of crusaders across the Holy Land and Jerusalem is being conquered right now so


you better prep

are for the saving of Jerusalem, heretic. The saving that wipes out the pathetic little t
hing


you call


your faith. You're fucking dead, squire. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill


you in over DCC ways, and that's just with my sword sheathed.
Not only am I extensively trained in religious combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Christian army, and I will use it to its fullest extent to wipe


your miserable asinus off the face of the Eastern Mediterranean,


you little stercore. If only


you could have known what holy retribution


your little "clever" religion was about to bring
down on


you, maybe


you would have converted to Christianity.
But


you couldn't,


you didn't, and now


you're paying the price,


you goddamn heathen. I will enact holy fury all over


you and


you will drown in it.
You're fucking dead, heretic.

Did


you actually laugh out loud, or did


you just breathe slightly louder than

do? Because having access to so much funny stuff on reddit has destroyed my sense of humour and I
don't t

Autism is a
high honor in the tech savvy misc
hievous meme addicted community. Autism isn't a pejorative but a badge of honor and understanding. Anon always aspires to be autistic and not be complacent with globalist s
hill ten
dies. To be autistic is to be part of keks army and to feed off of meme magick. Meme magick surrounds us all. Normies try to control memes and enforce their societal norms on it. T
his angers kek for kek gave us the gift of meme magick to shape the world. When a bunch of autists come together and harness the memes they can
do anyt
hing. When a normie hears Hillary Clinton talk about the dangers of a cartoon frog, she is discredited. But we know, we plan, we meme.

Anne frankly, I did nazi that coming. I literally came here to say t
his but boy, that escalated quickly so to the top with


you! Lost it at 'T
his is why we can't have nice t
hings' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm t
his gem has just won the internet and is
doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and w
hile that was a risky click, t
his post was a 9/10, 11/10 with rice, would read again. I see what


you did there and it feels good man. You're
doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at


your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like


you. You magnificent bastard;


you, sir,

are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how


you

are a redditor for 4 years, t
his checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for t
his cool story, bro. CTRL+F "about tree fiddy" was not disappointed. Wait, why
do I have


you tagged as "NOPE NOPE NOPE"? Nice try,


you monster. You

are now banned from /r/pyongyang What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as "YOU HAD ONE JOB". I can't fap to t
his. No true scotsman could see that t
his relevant XKCD was bad, and


you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see


your cakeday and raise


you a karma train. One
does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. Jet fuel can't melt dank memes, that stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fuzzy little man-peach, 2/10, would not bang. What is t

don't even know how is t

his will get buried but brace


yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When


you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But t

you wouldn't

You subhuman baboon.
You literal nigger.
How d

are


you speak,


you swarthy jungle monkey. How d

are


you open


your big lipped, rim encrusted, menthol cig

arette smelling mouth?
You

are human trash, Diego Tyrone LeShawn de Mara
dona. Universally despised, derided and mocked. Your nationality and skin tone offers no hope to the world that South America can ever prosper. Crawl back in to the Brazilian jungle


you came out of,


you literal orangutan.
I hope


you decide to sail


your grandfathers skip to the Falklands and rape some sheep, as is in the negroes nature. It would still be the w
hitest pussy


you ever had. Give Nigel and Robert a chance for some target practice,


your sole use to the world. Argentinians obsession with a few windswept islands in the Atlantic is
hilarious but sad. Coincidentally its the only worthw
hile contribution Argentina has made to the medical field. The MUH LAS MALVINAS sentiment in the average negro Argentinian is both an early warning sign of autism in c
hildren, and early on set Alzheimer's in adults.
Take


your black hairy fingers off


your keyboard, and never talk about the human species again,


you mockery of our supposed sh

ared ancestor.. No amount of olive oil and wheat flour slabbed on


your face every morning will make


you w
hite. It's about as delusional of an idea as


your daydreams of European heritage.
You nigger.
You make Bolivia look like a beacon of civilisation.
You

are the Baltimore of South America.
Go fertilise the pampas with


you and


your families corpses, its the best


you can hope for in life. For the first time in


your life, nigger,


you have a job making food for beings vastly superior to


yourself. Uruguayan cattle. Coincidentally, it would be the first time an Argentinian "man" provided for a family.
Die, Diego. No one would miss


you. Except for Australian Aboriginals, who now would have no one to make them look good.

I understand that


you're unfunny and unoriginal, and that


you've seen some vaguely japanese s
hit on reddit before where replies with "NANI?" got positive karma.
I realize that I may be speaking to a c

1)T
hink of somet

2)T
his comment is fucking retarded.
3) Anime is a mental disease. Stay away from it.
K, that's all.

Drake is gay dude. He's actually into guys. Furthermore drake is into


you. When


you hear that music? It's drake dicking


you right in the ear. Yeah that's right - drake is fucking


you in the ear. He's for women.


you're a man and listening to
him. He's fucking


you in the ear all right. Stop getting fucked in the ear by drake. That was a poet by me.

I thought fidget spinning was a dumb trend, but then I got mine. I felt the spin, I felt it on my finger, I felt the rush of a good spin. It changed me. I got my spinner ironically, but I was wrong.
Its amazing, I'm smarter, more productive, more focused at work, a simple task is now much better.
Outsiders

What the fuck Target!? What the actual fuck!? You fucking sold me a Peach fucking Snapple without telling me about the full consequences of drinking t

you buy it!! Fucking Target is so pro-gay that they try to sell


you t
his fucking gay potion bulls
hit to promote their liberal agenda!! I was t
hirstin' pretty hard last Thursday, and I stopped by my local Target to quench my t
hirst. Me being the innocent little boy I am, I decided to buy a nice Peach Snapple so I wouldn't DIE OF THIRST, but when I went up to the register to buy it the fucking cas
hier DIDN'T TELL ME THAT PEACH FUCKING SNAPPLE MAKES YOU GAY!! I drank the Peach Snapple and now I can't stop sucking dick!! All the cute boys at school won't stop making fun of me, and I can't tell my p

arents because then the boys won't let me suck their dicks anymore!!! so BE WARNED boys, Peach Snapple makes


you gay and Target
doesn't give two s

your political beliefs or


your HOMOSEXUALITY!!

hing to say in 2008.
Fuck literally everyt
hing about Reddit, constantly encouraging retards to post variations of these same 3 words on every goddamn post they see. You couldn't even bother to come up with replacements for "fake" and "gay", yet for some reason


you're still sitting at the top of the comments.

im like a gamer muslim girl and like evry time i play roblox (its a rreal game shut up) everyone is like "show me ur tits" or "allahu akbar!!" but like i
dont even kno what either of those mean (like wat???) but those arnt even the worst ones like they sometime say t
hing like "go back to isis" like thats very rude like my uncle is in isis and like i already visited
him like a month ago so like why would i go again (like wat????) and like isis is pretty cool actually so like why
do people ahte it?? also like when i play call of duty (im only 12 and my mom
dosnt let me play im such a rebel XDD) ppl tell me to like turn off my voice changr and its like its my real voice how can i change it (like wat??) and lik they aslo say like "trump will kik


you out" but like i support
donald trump so like why would he kick me out (like wat??) anyway like it sucks to be a gamer muslim girl

He always sits back and watches me, and he knows tiny little tidbits about the nations I play. Like the PLC union, or the Iberian wedding. He's even starting to develop a fiery hatred for blue t
hings. Just last week, he bit a man in a blue s
hirt and shouted "BBB!" Sometimes we find
him late at night poking holes in a print-out jpeg of a Turkish flag.
He went to school yesterday and the teacher sent
him home early, because they were talking about Native Americans and they had a writing assignment, so he wrote
down "they

are savegis

are bad."
I need help. How
do I stop t
his? I fear that when he gets old enough to play the game
himself, he will learn tips on how to enact
his twisted fantasies.

Honestly, the United States and Japan

are the two best countries on Earth. Being a weaboo in the states is pretty much the pinnacle of existence. I remember one time after I had been hunting, I was skinning the deer in my barn w
hile watc
hing the sunset over the rolling mountains and playing Azumanga Daioh on my laptop, and I masturbated to Tomo so hard I accudentally knocked over my gun. When I finally came back to my senses post-orgasm I st

ared at my flag and thought "God bless the USA". Those other countries just
don't offer anyt
hing like that, so they
don't matter for anyt
hing beyond selling me oil.

Whenever I masturbate, I
do a lot of foreplay. I write
down "Precum" on a sheet of paper, and stick the pen in my ass. I massage my foreskin and put a grapefruit with the centre hollowed out over my cock until I start leaking. Then I begin the full grapefruiting, stopping when I'm just on the edge. I get on the table, and try to cross out the "pre" on the note with the pen still inside me. The pressure of it being presssed against my prostrate usually causes me to ejaculate all over the note. It reminds myself that I became a better person than before.

There's been an uptick recently in pastas with emojis. Although sometimes funny and creative there

are a lot of submissions with them and they usually get plenty of upvotes. Ever since the "good s
hit" pasta came out there

are submissions with low quality variants posted frequently.
We've received complaints that emojis were flooding the sub and although we
don't want to ban them outright,


your submission could be removed from the sub if it's an emojipasta. We want to give more traditional text pasta a chance at the frontpage. If


your pasta consists of primarly emojis like t
his and t
his, post it to /r/emojipasta.
/r/emojipasta is newer but specializes in these kind of pastas. There's also /r/goods
hitpasta for that good s
hit craving.

Update: As of March 2 we will be removing primarily emojipastas and directly to /r/emojipasta. That sub is now popular enough to catch most of them beforehand. If


you see anyt
hing that
doesn't belong here
please report it.

YOU KNOW THEY SAY ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, BUT YOU LOOK AT ME AND YOU LOOK AT SOMOA JOE AND YOU CAN SEE THAT STATEMENT IS NOT TRUE! SEE NORMALLY IF YOU GO 1 ON 1 WITH ANOTHER WRESTLER YOU GOT A 50/50 CHANCE OF WINNING. BUT I'M A GENETIC FREAK, AND I'M NOT NORMAL! SO YOU GOT A 25% AT BEST AT BEAT ME! AND THEN YOU ADD KURT ANGLE TO THE MIX - YOU THE CHANCES OF WINNING DRASTIC GO DOWN. SEE THE THREE-WAY AT SACRIFICE YOU GOT A 33 AND A 3rd CHANCE OF WINNING. BUT I! I GOT A 66 AND 2/3 CHANCE OF WINNING 'CAUSE KURT ANGLE KNOOOWS HE CAN'T BEAT ME, AND HE'S NOT EVEN GONNA TRY! SO SOMOA JOE, YOU TAKE YOUR 33 AND A THIRD CHANCE, MINUS MY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT CHANCE, AND YOU'VE GOT AN EIGHT AND A THIRD CHANCE OF WINNING AT SACRIFICE. BUT THEN YOU TAKE MY 75 CHANCE OF WINNING (IF WE WAS TO GO 1 ON 1) AND THEN ADD 66 S PERCENTS - I GOT A 141 AND TWO THIRDS CHANCE OF WINNING AT SACRIFICE! SENIOR JOE; THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE, AND THEY SPELL DISASTER FOR YOU, AT SACRIFICE!

Your link
doesn't, well... link for me.
Edit: Nevermind it's working now. It was probably my phone. Anyways, yes I agree.... I would very much like to have a cute Asian girl and a fake bomb. I would probably choose the Asian c
hick first though, because well, frankly, I've never banged an Asian c
hick before. I feel like it would be fun, like the forbidden fruit I guess. Plus, "Asian girl" is probably my most clicked on Pornhub tab after "MILF" and "lesbian".

you! The whole Air Bud Pentology is genius and cinema at its absolute best. The intricate, character driven plots and multi-movie story arches hark back to Charles Dickens. Even the spin-off content, produced mainly to fill in the supposed plot holes of the main movies, were so well made and written with such elegance and verbosity that it makes one wonder if they had been planned from the very beginning. The stressful intra-family dynamics portrayed in the films gives such a poignant parallel to our own human lives. Buddy is constantly struggling to balance
his hectic life as a sports super star, a loving partner to Molly, and as good role model to
his 5 c
hildren. Yet, Buddy's inability to handle all three tasks at once show that he possesses human characteristics. Buddy is a workaholic from a blue collar town, always looking for the next job by w
hich to support
his family, and as a result neglects Molly and the ever-rebellious Bud
dies. The Bud
dies, having little contact with their father,

are constantly forced to act as adults at too


young an age. Being denied their c
hildhood, they become runaway pups and eventually turn to a life of vigilante crime. T
his is over the course of the entire franc
hise that we see Buddy's start as


young blue coll

ared
dog who
hit upon the American Dream, turning into a well-meaning but ill prep

ared father whose unrealistic ideals end up manifesting in
his c
hildren. It's beautiful. But


you
don't get that,
do


you? The series touches upon so many cultural phenomenon w
hich

are synonymous with being a modern day human, but views them through the naive and hopeful eyes of human's closest allies. From the scat
hing religious commentary of Santa Bud
dies (2009) to the critical, honest and honestly surprisingly wide reac
hing look at the modern day gladiators that

are American Foot Ball players in Air Bud: Golden Receiver (1998), it's almost impossible to deny Air Bud's prominent role in the advancement of American culture in the last 20 years. It's fabulous. Genius. Each film a Magnum Opus.
And


you call it a cash grabbing hunk of s
hit? You, who hasn't even seen the main Air Bud Pentology, much less the lesser side works like Monkey Up (2016) or Russel Madness (2015)? Have

My crush just added me on Facebook, I was so happy, when I clicked on her profile and went into her profile she had so many photos of herself in a bikini, lucky for me I can picture her naked beneath that bikini, so being the man I was, I flopped out my dick and started masturbating to her pics, it only took 5 seconds to cum, I decided to confess my love for her so I took the photo of my mess, sent it to her on messenger and went to sleep hoping that she'll have sex with me at school. The next day, I woke up, got to school and sat with all 7 of my friends who make sex jokes, dark jokes and make fun of feminism, I was the most quiet of the group but whenever I talk I say somet
hing funny, anyways when I sat
down one of my mates Sebastian said "Nice sperm ya sick cunt!' He said, at first I was confused and asked " Your fucking sperm ya sick cunt, ya sent it to ya crush! You're fucked cunt!" My heart sank lower than a bomb ready to explode, all my friends started laug

I used to watch Disney cartoons as a c
hild, and I always loved Donald Duck. And I
don't mean he was my favorite character, I mean I loved Donald Duck. Not sexually, of course, as I was around seven years old, but I definitely was fascinated with
him to an unusual degree. I had told my p

arents I wanted to grow up to be a duck, and I would even walk around with my arms at my sides, just like a duck. I would eat bread and crackers as a snack, and would try to swim around in the community pool using just my feet, just like a duck would. Donald was my i
dol, and I wanted to be just like
him. Well, the one obvious shortcoming that I had is that my voice wasn't like a duck's voice. Donald spoke in such a unique way, and surely t
his was the t
hing that I needed to emulate to be more like
him. And then I had a moment of brilliance.
My family's
dog ripped apart one of its toys, and my p

arents asked me to throw the scraps away. Buried in the pile of stuffing and cloth was the squeaker. I put it to my mouth and blew on it, and it made a loud squeaky sound. The light bulb clicked on it my head, and without hesitation I swallowed it. Luckily, but to my dismay, it didn't get lodged in my throat and allow me to talk like a duck. However, I
do remember passing it and seeing it floating in the toilet. When I flushed the squeaker
down the toilet, I felt like I flushed my dreams of being a duck
down with it.

What is so funny about copypasta? Someone put a lot of time in writing out a wall of text, and all


you
do is just copy and paste it? Unbelievable. Freaking unbelievable. It is so fucking disrespectful for the original writter to have
his thoughts repeated over and over just for some kind of sick joke. You fools know the CSU copypasta, right? People chuckle at it because he was "very mad". Well, t
hink about it, motherfucker. What if he WAS very mad? What if he actually had feelings and
his day was ruined? Ever t
hink about it like that? No, of course not. You tools just took
his words over and over and used it for s
hits and giggles. How fucking rude. At t
his point, my 10 page essay on why I t
hink Brawl is ass could be used as a copypasta. That is just fucking wrong on so many levels. I'm not going to write out a copypasta myself, because I
don't want my words to be shat out over and over again. I'm just expressing my thoughts and feelings on the abuse of copypasta. It just needs to fucking stop.

do so out of recognition. The first person to ever upvote dat boi did not
do so because a pre-existing meme format. The first person to ever upvote dat boi upvoted a meme literally pulled from the ether by sheer human creativity and willpower. Dat boi is evidence that humans can st

Hi I am a 13 year old virgin. I have never had sex, I've never been kissed on the lips, and I've never been kissed on the cheek. I want to find a girl who will love me forever.

I want to cuddle her every single night and have sex with her (con

are gay). I want to love her. I want her to love me. I
don't want to be lonely. I know I'll find someone someday. If I find nobody, I will honestly kill myself. I want to be loved. If

Seriously? After 20 minutes of getting to choke t
his gorgeous girl with
his cock, two little poots of cum is all he could manage? Pathetic. I registered an account just so I could leave t

you're some alpha male, w

do


you give her? Two tiddlywinks of cum? I've never felt so personally offended by porn before. You're a real asshole, pal.

As a Russian and a Jew it is my god given right to punch Nazis. Every day I wake up in the morning and feel the sunlight on my face, and I smile. I go outside and beat the everliving s
hit out of some fascists w
hile taking a stroll to my neighborhood Rite Aid to get some yummy Rainbow Sherbet. After I finish my ice cream, I recline on my favorite park bench and wait for Nazis to pass by so I can knock their teeth out. After a long hard day of nazi-beating, I go home and have a refres
hing glass of Babushka's kompot. I am proud of the fact that I am Russian and Jewish, and that my ethnicity allows me to beat up Nazis.

my mom just said I'm grounded and I'm MAD
Ok so I was smoking the marijuana (if


you know what I mean) when my fucking bitch mom came in and started yelling at me for smoking!!! Naturally I started throwing my piss bottles at her and managed to get some piss in her eyes. I was pretty excited so I gave her the finger. Little did she know that I just used that finger to FINGER my GIRLFRIEND (yeah that's right she's a GIRL). Anyway, app

arently that wasn't "acceptable in t

I just did sex so hard to t
his girl. She was moaning and stuff and i did sex so hard and so good with her. She was all "Please have good sex with me" and I said back "Yeah, I'm going to really sex


you so great lady" and she's like "Thanks". It was so good and so hot and we both loved making a sex on all the positions. At the end I was all "Hey, I'm going to finish sex now" and she said "Yes, that would be nice if


you finished so hard on that towel". I said "Yes" and I finished so hard on the towel. And It was so hot.

People joke and laugh and criticize how a movement embo
died by the phrase "Dicks out for Harambe!" can ever gain momentum and grow into more than a bad joke w

are one and the same, animals in t

Everyone still remember very clearly why it is NOT a good idea to piss me off. During a soccer game at my
high school one newish ref d

ared to give me a yellow card for my supposed "violating" tackle. I told
him


you
don't know s

his qualification. He refused then I told
him I am not only a soccer player, I am also a ken
do, karate, ju
do, and many more martial arts practitioner. He seemed intimidated and I offered
him a chance to round up the situation.
Then it happened, the dude from the other team who was supposed to be "injured" from my tackle started to berate me. I told the ref to prep

are
his Red Card because now the ground is also going to turn red. I approached the guy face on and he started to back off. Some of
his mates started to come to me to restrain me, a single gl

your face is the ball. In one swift motion he fell like a giraffe. Squealing in the ground, I did NOT stop. His friends now tried to restrain me. In the end it took eight guys to stop my rampage.
Needless to say the game is cancelled. My mates and the opponents now have a newfound respect for me. I will stand against rule breaker.

Ok so I'm pretty new to t
his whole dating t
hing, theres t
his girl I really like in my math class and I wanted to be her boyfriend, theres these really cool guys in grade 9 and they have sex about five times a day, they say that girls love it when boys show them their penis.
So in my next math class I stole a seat next to her and st

ared at her boobs, I became erection and pulled it out through the fly of my pants, as I was about to tap her on the shoulder so she could see my penis, t
his other girl that has no boobs and is ugly screamed "oh my god!", screaming and pointing at my penis.
I stood up to tell her to shut up and go away, but my penis was still hanging out from my pants, all the class was looking at it, I didn't want them to see my penis because it meant I would have to have sex with everybody in the room. I tried to make t
hings right by swooping over to the girl I like and bringing my penis up to her face close up, t
his made it clear that I wanted her to see my penis and not the rest of the class.
She screamed and tried to stab me with a pen, but she missed and stuck it up my bum, it felt really good, and some weird clear goo shot out from my penis and
hit her in the face, she ran out of the room crying and I got sent to the office.
My penis was caught in my zipper, so I had to leave it hanging out there for a w
hile longer, but then classes ended and everybody entered the hallway, everybody saw my penis, and I now have to have sex with the entire school.
I
don't understand what happen, why

are ufly girls so nosy, and why did the girl I like run away? Is my penis very small, I
do not understand.

Don't


you fucking d

are talking s
hit about Undertale,


you fucking idiot.
You surely

are a crybaby
hippie
hipster hater that likes to s
hit on popular t
hings to be edgy. Guess what, dumbass? Undertale is the best game! And if


you disagree


you

are simply ignorant. I bet


you

are a fucking normie that t
hinks Halo is better. Fuck


you.
I used to be ignorant, too, not much of a gamer until I discovered the glory of Undertale. The characters, the plot, the humor, the gameplay, the music. It was simply perfect. It touched my heart and changed my life...
I've tried other so called "good" games like earthbound, zelda, yume nikki, off, but they all suck, they

are all horrible pieces of s
hit comp

ared to Undertale. Toby Fox is the God of videogames and Undertale is the masterpiece of humanity that all gamers should bow
down to.

Sometimes I'll get my girlfriend a nice big ice cream cone at the McDonald's drive-thru, just like that, then once she leans forward to take a bite, I'll floor the car then slam on the breaks so the entire frozen yogurt castle smashes into her face.
"You little schemer!" she cries out, laug

"Fuck

Long Side note:  We fucking BLOCKED Disney channel in our house.  Yes, we BLOCKED Disney.  Why?  The shows have become full of bitchy little "fuck


you", attitude loaded - s
hit for brains shows where Mom and Dad

are portrayed as idiots who just want to get in the way of kids havin' fun,
dont'cha know.   I post t
his - still feeling a bit shocked.  I mean, Disney?  Fucking DISNEY?  But our little girl became addicted to the Disney Hanna Montana type shows, they're really compelling, especially to little girls.  And we noted her sass factor went thru the roof when she started watc
hing t
his tripe.  WTF?  Again - I'm still flabbergasted.  So, we did a test and (LIED) and told her the Disney wasn't available on DirecTV for a bit.  Well smack my ass an call me Sally, but removing the Disney "p

arents

are idiots" tripe from her entertainment menu worked.  Worked freaking amazingly well.  So, we thought maybe we're mistaking correlation with causation, so I told my wife I'd enable Disney and not tell her when.  Ok, not
double blind but for home "science" better than just bending over to Walt and
his minoins....
In 4 or 5 days after re-enabling Disney channel my wife took me aside and said "fucking hell honey, PLEASE tell me


you turned Disney back on!".  Yes - I had turned Disney back on..  She was actually relieved.
So to t
his date forward, Disney is 100% blocked out on our DirecTV boxes.  Mind


you folks I'm not a prude, oh fucking hell no.  Our kids go to South Beach every year with Mom and Pop, we're actually quite liberal with life, free
dom, and entertainment content.  But t
his Disney s
hit??? If there were a Satan, he'd be at the forefront of producing t
his tripe bulls
hit.

For me, it's the McC
hicken. The best fast food sandwich. I even ask for extra McC
hicken sauce packets and the staff is so friendly and more than willing to oblige.
One time I asked for McC
hicken sauce packets and they gave me three. I said, "Wow, three for free!" and the nice friendly McDonald's worker laughed and said, "I'm going to call


you 3-for-free!".
Now the staff greets me with "hey it's 3-for-free!" and ALWAYS give me three packets. It's such a fun and cool atmosphere at my local McDonald's restaurant, I go there at least 3 times a week for lunch and a large iced coffee with milk instead of cream, 1-2 times for breakfast on the weekend, and maybe once for dinner when I'm in a rush but want a great meal that is affordable, fast, and can match my daily nutritional needs.
I even dip my fries in McC
hicken sauce, it's delicious! What a great restaurant.

Today on How They Do It : Plumbuses.
Everyone has a plumbus in their home. First they take the dingle bop and they smooth it out with a bunch of schleem. The schleem is then...repurposed for later batches.
They take the dingle bop and they push it through the grumbo, where the fleeb is rubbed against it. It's important that the fleeb is rubbed, becasue the fleeb has all the fleeb juice.
Then, a schlami shows up, and he rubs it...and spits on it.
They cut the fleeb. There's several
hizzards in the way.
The blamfs rub against the chumbles, and the...plubis, and grumbo

are shaved away.
That leaves


you with...a regular old plumbus.

What's t
his


you've said to me, my good friend? Ill have


you know I graduated top of my class in conflict resolution, and Ive been involved in numerous friendly discussions, and I have over 300 confirmed friends. I am trained in polite discussions and I'm the top mediator in the entire neighborhood. You

are worth more to me than just another target. I hope we will come to have a friends
hip never before seen on t
his Earth. Don't


you t
hink


you might be hurting someone's feelings saying that over the internet? T
hink about it, my friend. As we speak I am contacting my good friends across the USA and


your P.O. box is being traced right now so


you better prep

are for the greeting cards, friend. The greeting cards that help


you with


your hate. You should look forward to it, friend. I can be anywhere, anytime for


you, and I can calm


you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my chess set. Not only am I extensively trained in conflict resolution, but I have access to the entire group of my friends and I will use them to their full extent to start our new friends
hip. If only


you could have known what kindness and love


your little comment was about to bring


you, maybe


you would have reached out sooner. But


you couldn't,


you didn't, and now we get to start a new friends
hip,


you unique person. I will give


you gifts and


you might have a hard time keeping up. You're finally living, friend.

Okay, I didn't want it to come to t
his, but I really have no option now other than to just rant. Fuck team Valor. Seriously. Fuck those motherfucking cocksuckkng pokebitches. First of all, their message/goal. "To make our Pokemon strong by battling (fighting). WTF? Pokemon

are supposed to be our companions and friends, and these assfuckers treat them as not
hing more than tools of war and destruction. Like, they t
hink t
his is a fucking game or somet
hing. Second, their actual team members. They're all either:
A. Skateboard punks
B. Weeaboos
C. Actual convicted felons
Or D. All of the above.
Not to mention losers and virgins, but that's already assumed from the other t
hings. And the only friends they have

are other team Valor members. Yeah, that's right, it's basically a giant circle jerk about they're the best, even though they

aren't. God, I just hate how they act like they're better than everyone else, just because of a fictional team in a video game. It really gets on my fucking nerves. Just a bunch of c
hildren taking a game too seriously. And
don't even get me started on team Instinct. In fact, they're so irrelevant that I'm not even going to rant about them. Anyway, thanks for letting me get that out, I really needed it. Team Mystic for life.

I
don't t
hink YOU should been heard from/seen. I also dislike


you immensely. That dumb dips
hit statement was incredibly stupid, as

are


you. I t
hink everyone lost some intelligence by taking their time to read that s
hit without responding. You

are an ignorant adult that is unaw

are of the


youth oppression that is occurring in society right now. Now go stand in a corner and cry as


you t
hink about how these

are all true. The truth hurts,
doesn't it, bitch? You got owned by a c
hild.

Every day my erections gets harder, my sessions get longer, and my loads get larger. I feel myself becoming more and more attached to the idea of sex to the point where I feel like if I
don't get intimate soon, I will explode. My hands get red from pulling and my arms get tired of moving up and
down. My right arm already has more muscle mass than my left and it is very noticeable. Sometimes I have to take breaks between yanking it to cool off because I exert myself so much. My family is worried because I hardly come out of my room anymore. I used to have one session a day, then it became two, then three, now I'm bordering on four a day. I'm losing sleep because of it. I'm averaging 5-6 hours of sleep a night. My grades and social life

are suffering. Whenever I speak to girls, I imagine scenarios and fantasies in my head. It
doesn't even need to be a hot girl. Any female I lay eyes upon, I t
hink of taking back to my house. My fantasies and fetishes

are expanding. One day it's lingerie, the next it's incest. I
don't know if my fetishes

are wrong or right, and at t
his point I
don't c

are. I just need to be loved.

T
his reminds me of the time I went to McDonalds and I wanted a Shrek toy but all they had was Barbie and so I started crying but then I remembered that Barbie toys have boobies so I got one with my Happy Meal and took it home and then touched my peepee until my yogurt came out and it got on the barbie so I asked my sister to help clean it up because she's a girl and girls like to clean and instead of grabbing paper towels she just licked it off and said it was good so she then licked it off my peepee and my peepee got hard again so 20 minutes later she licked my peepee and more yogurt came out and she swallowed it and so now sometimes she asks for my yogurt because she said it makes her feel good and so now I play with Barbies and my sister joins in too and we have fun

you

are now
done

guys, i just realized that lil uzi vert's "xo tour llif3" is about neon genesis evangelion. more specifically, it's a first person reflection from s
hinji's point of view about
his mental state, and in particular
his deteriorating relations
hips with the other characters, at a very specific point in the show (second half of ep. 23 to the first half of ep. 24 before kaworu shows up). hear me out here.
"phantom that's all red
inside all w
hite"
these lines reflect on
his relations
hip with misato. the "phantom that's all red" line is clearly a reference to misato's car (in the song acting as a synec
doche for misato herself) but the "inside all w
hite" part is more complicated. if


you'll recall, after rei's sacrifice in episode 23, misato tries to comfort s
hinji by making a sexual advance towards
him, and s
hinji recoils away from her. t
his is subtle and easy to miss, but it represents a huge change in the way s
hinji views misato. prior to t
his moment, misato had been somet
hing of a replacement guardian for s
hinji, but when he is forced to see her in a sexual manner, that image shatters and he can no longer feel comfortable around her. w
hite is the color of semen, therefore in the line "inside all w
hite" the color w
hite symbolizes
his altered view of misato after being subject to her sexual advances.
"my brittany got mad
i'm b

arely her man now"
these lines refer to asuka, the closest t
hing s
hinji has to a "girlfriend" in the show. asuka is, as


you know, an extremely abrasive person, but there were implications that s
hinji may have been able to break
down her walls and their relations
hip could have advanced. however, due to the trauma asuka experiences in episode 22, in w
hich all of her deep-seated insecurities were dragged up to the surface of her mind (and also probably due to undiagnosed borderline personality disorder), she becomes even more defensive and guarded. she is especially furious with s
hinji, in whom she sees her own weakness, and projects her intense self-loat
hing onto
him, ruining any chance of them forming a relations
hip, hence "i'm b

arely her man now".
"everybody got the same swag now
watch the way that i tear it
down"
these lines

are about the incident between s
hinji and toji. in episode 17, toji is selected to be the fourth c
hild, meaning that, since they

are both nerv pilots, he and s
hinji have "the same swag". however, when an angel
hijacks toji's eva and s
hinji refuses to destroy it, gen
do inserts a dummy system to
do the task instead, and s
hinji is forced to "watch the way that [he] tears it
down." as a result, toji is horribly crippled, and s
hinji's guilt over the incident accelerates
his
downward spiral.
"shoulda saw the way she looked me in my eye
she said 'baby, i am not afraid to
die'"
these lines refer to rei's sacrifice in episode 23. rei is essentially a soulless husk created by nerv for the purpose of the instrumentality project, and as such, she has absolutely no qualms about throwing her life away. to s
hinji, however, she is a complex and fully realized person, and he feels a connection with her to some extent. that connection is shattered, though, when he meets rei iii, who, despite having the same appearance as the rei he thought he knew, is a completely stranger to
him. at t
his moment, s
hinji realizes that he never really knew rei at all, and
his loneliness is intensified.
"all my friends

are dead
push me to the edge"
finally, t
his simple refrain reinforces that the disintegration of all s
hinji's relations
hips is causing
him to sink deeper and deeper into the emotional anguish that will go on to kickstart the t
hird impact.
so there


you have it, a full analysis of how "xo tour llif3" is about neon genesis evangelion. feel free to ask questions if


you have any

I've been collecting these for a w
hile and have about 60-80 currently. Since KYM sucks, here is a short writeup about the infamous pasta.
T
his is the original.

What the fuck did


you just fucking say about me,

are not

you the fuck out with precision the likes of w

hink


you can get away with saying that s
hit to me over the Internet? T
hink again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and


your IP is being traced right now so


you better prep

are for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little t
hing


you call


your life. Youre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill


you in over seven hundred ways, and thats just with my b

are hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe


your miserable ass off the face of the continent,


you little s
hit. If only


you could have known what unholy retribution


your little clever comment was about to bring
down upon


you, maybe


you would have held


your fucking tongue. But


you couldnt,


you didnt, and now


youre paying the price,


you goddamn idiot. I will s
hit fury all over


you and


you will drown in it. Youre fucking dead, kid
do.

W
hich came from OperatorChan's copypasta board back in 2010. OP made a thread recently remarking on how today was the happiest day of
his life because they made the pasta about 2 years ago. Here is a link to one of the earliest uses from 4chan's /jp/ board (now arc
hived). The subsequent reply confirms the source. There is also another aside comment on how the pasta wouldn't go anywhere because it was way too long. It was later posted on other boards and quickly picked up steam from there.
It is believed that the ancestor to t
his pasta seems to be t
his one w
hich was posted on /a/ around 2009, a year before t
his version took off. Other posts from the arc
hive confirm the dates. (NSFW)
I'll be posting the variations via comments. Feel free to contribute if


you have any that I'm missing. Some of them have Unknown on them. If


you know what version or perspective they

are from,
please comment.
I also have responses to the pasta: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 9.1 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
I will continue to update t

T

his trap like the pawn she is.
T
his is not an average man


you're dealing with here. Make no mistake, t
his is a genius beyond

Now that he has a full mental blueprint of

him. Expect somet

Mark my words, the lion has been let out of the cage, and he's hungry tonight. So go now, retreat to

My eyes

are literally bloodshot red from crying for the last hour, and I just threw up from the stress. I can't believe we lost again. The president sexually assaults people, the Republican in Montana bodyslams people, and t
his bitch in Georgia refuses to let women with breast cancer get treatment. And the worst part is people still vote for them! It's happening. We

are in 1930s Nazi Germany. We must resist.

Let's start with logic t
hinking.  We will apply these questions to a trap, and it will help determine if they

are gay.
Does the person have a masculine penis? No, they have a feminine penis.
Is the person a man? No, they

are called dickgirls for a reason.
Does a man have a numerical value of 1? No, not only is that not the case, but a man (or a woman) has no numerical value. T
his is nonsense.
Is it gay to be fucked by a girl? No, if t
his was the case then all heterosexual sex would in fact be homosexual in nature.
Suffice to say, I t
hink we can all agree that traps

are not gay using quick and easy logic t
hinking.
Now, we will use imagination t
hinking to imagine a situation in w
hich


you

are having sexual intercourse with a trap.

Ok, so like imagine t
his c
hick; but she's t
his totally fucking SMOKING hot c
hick, and she's got really sexy titties and a sexy butthole that


you can pound and a sexy little feminine penis


you can stroke and suck.

Did that feel gay? I thought not.
We have used both of the types of t
hinking to solve the mystery of if traps

are gay.  They

are not.  I have used indisputable science techniques to skip the hypothesis completely and go straight to a proof.  Science t
hinking is a secret t
hird type of t
hinking that many people
don't have so t
his may be a difficult concept to grasp for some.
I am happy to explain my theorem further and am opening t
his thread to discussion.

your beautiful little girl - reading her stories at bedtime, making her go to sports practice, making sure she had a healthy
diet, educating her, playing with her. All of it has one simple result: her body is more enjoyable for the men that will eventually fuck her in every hole.
Raised the perfect girl? Great. Who benefits? If


you're lucky, a ran
dom man who had not
hing to
do with the way she grew up, who marries her. He gets to fuck her tight pussy every night. He gets the benefits of her kind and sweet personality that came from the way


you raised her.
As a man who has a daughter,


you

are LITERALLY dedicating at least 20 years of


your life simply to raise a girl for another man to enjoy. It is the ULTIMATE AND FINAL cuck. T
hink about it logically

Has anyone noticed somet
hing wrong with Cummybot recently? He's gone a bit... Weird. Seriously, somebody go fix
him
please. He's becoming a Dummybot.

Nerds

are over rated and deserve to be bullied.
Quite frankly, I find it
hilarious how girls and


young women seem to be wet for nerds, even fictional ones. Like, of all the men there

are in the world,


you choose nerds? Why? Are


you that insecure about


yourself


you have to go for crap?
Contrary to what nerds try to brainwash


you into believing, they
don't land decent jobs at all. They're often too introverted or rigid to be CEO's or bosses. I know a guy who matches literally the exact stereotype of a nerd, he even wears horn rimmed glasses and a bowtie. He went to University to get a degree in P
hilosophy. Like seriously? Wow dude,


you're so smart, I'm sure a degree in P
hilosophy is truly going to land


you a great job and


you will change the world!
Also, nerds

aren't really smart to begin with. Oh, look, t
his guy's nerdy acting and he's good at math! He's so smart! Except he's not. I suck at math but I'm smart because I know how to deal with people and put them in their place, and I use creative and abstract t
hinking. THAT is the kinda stuff that gets


you somewhere.
Besides with the fact that nerds just act so.. well 'nerdy' and cringy all the time, it makes ME uncomfortable and it's disrespectful to other people by making them uncomfortable. I remember being in
highschool and I'd make friends with everyone, except for nerds. They just ended up taking me for granted and basically hated my guts because I wasn't some robotic person with a rigid mentality. Then they make excuses and say people hate them because of their 'knowledge'. Like quit making excuses some very intelligent people

are well liked, nerd and intelligent

aren't always the same t
hing.
Nerds

are not 'cute', nerds

aren't 'sweet' and they're not even that intelligent. You might as well date a methhead. At least the methhead might have some creative thoughts and not act like a friggen awkward robot. I have trouble even believing nerds

are people.
Also, most serial killers

are nerds so good luck getting killed in some extremely weird way such as having holes drilled in


your head or ending up in a nerd's stomach. I love me some serial killer
documentaries!

Slavs(fake w
hite people), were a race that originated deep underground. Slavs had mystical squatting powers, and very
high alcohol tolerance. They drilled out of the surface 10,000 years ago, and lived among humans.
They scammed their way to the bottom of society, and isolated themselves from their allies. Pilsudski, the rebellious slav, taught independence from Russia, and rejected CSGO spammers. He used
his mystical slav magic channeled from Ivan the Terrible
himself to perform miracles. New slavs became poles, and old slavs stayed slavs.
They have no ideology except to get to the liquor store, w
hich they failed, as the finns have already surpassed them, so they used finns, like Mannerheim and Schaumann to buy vodka  and use it for their own purposes.
They failed that too, and now a german (trump) is president. Germans

are a species that also originated deep underground like Slavs. The slavs were allies with the Germans, and that is why slavs love trump. Trump's real name is Drumpf, a common german last name. Slavs called
him that to try to expose
him as a German, but no one else besides the slavs know about Germans

Ok, 'tis be ABSOLUTE fuckin' bulls
hit. I went to spy wit' ye eye Cars in th' theater yesterday, 'n when Lightnin' McQueen got steamin' wit' Sally in Radiator Sprin's, me boner engaged. When Lightnin' McQueen said "Ka-Chow!", I couldn't help it!!! I closed me eyes, 'n I TORE me dick to shreds, usin' w
hip like motions 'n pulled wit' great force. That was one 'o th' best nuts I ever had, just t
hinkin' 'bout it now gets me riled up. T
hin' be, I nutted all over th' lad
die sittin' right next to me, 'n
his mom got all pissed at me, screamin' at me fer jackin' off on her son. I told that scallywag to shut th' muck up, 'n that jackin' off be a natural, artistic, 'n beautiful process. ye BE grog-filled that me semen be all over ye son, maybe he can learn a lesson or a pair 'bout th' culture 'n art 'o jackin' off. HOWEVER, th' movie theater managers didn't agree wit' me. They KICKED ME OUT 'o th' movie theater, 'n I didn't even finish watc
hin' th' Cars movie. Not only THAT, but they made me spit s
hine up me semen after it already dried out 'n solidified on th' seats. THATS TORTURE!! Do ye be knowin' how harrrd it be to spit s
hine semen after its dried out? ye spit s
hine semen after its FRESH out 'o ye cock, not an hour after ye fuckin' nutted. 'tis be a fuckin' OUTRAGE. Do ye really expect me to not w
hip out me cock 'n jack off when i spy wit' ye eye a steamin' sex scene in a movie? Either ban sex scenes in movies, or LET ME jack off in ye theater, assholes.-

I called 1-800-Dominos to order a pizza. Little did I know what an
ordeal awaited me. When I ordered the pizza, I heard numerous ethnic
slurs towards black people being shouted in the background in Spanish.
T
hinking it was probably just racous customers, I proceeded to order a
large pizza and hot wings, I was really hungry. I then waited
patiently for one hour for my pizza to arrive.
At around one hour and
t
hirty minutes, I called and asked what was going on with the pizza.
The


young man on the phone brazenly told me to "C
hill out nigga, yo
pizza will be there soon" When I demanded
his name, he refused to give
it to me, and hung up. I called back and got a different person who

swears he has no idea what happened, and that the pizza would be there
soon. I waited another half hour before finally calling back to
cancel the pizza, hungrier than I have ever been in my life even after
surviving hurricane katrina with no food and water for days. I was
told ok, fine, we will credit


your card, no problem.
I resigned myself
to going to bed hungry, but then when I had
dozed off for like fifteen
minutes, I heard tires screac
hing outside and someone laying on their
horn for what seemed like almost half a minute, waking up all my
neighbors. When I went outside to see if someone was shot or what in
the world was going on, I found none other than the
dominos pizza
delivery driver with my order now a full TWO HOURS and fifteen minutes
late.
The


young man, a latino with no nametag, appe

ared extremely
disheveled and absolutely REEKED of marihuana smoke. He was also
blaring loud
hispanic rap music from
his car, loudly playing lyrics
glorifying rape. I attempted to check the pizza to see if my order was
correct, but the


young man refused to let me touch the boxes until I
signed the credit card slip and "Gave
him an extra somet
hing" When I
threatened to call
his manager he replied "I AM YO MOTHAFU$!@ MANAGER,
BITCH". I could not believe that t
his crazy drug addict was yelling at
me. I became extremely nervous that t
his


young man was going to attack
me physically, but when I finally got the pizza, I found it was NOT
what I ordered, and furthermore, it was stone cold. I mentioned t
his
to the


young man, who then grabbed the pizza box out of my hands and
threw it onto the hood of my neighbor's car, spraying cold pizza sauce
all over
his newly simonized Camaro. "You NIGGERS
don't DESERVE
pizza!" he yelled, brandis
hing an unlit marijuana cig

arette. He then
got in
his car and peeled out, sideswiping one of my across-the-street
neighbor's cars.
I called 1-800
dominos and tried to tell them t
his
story but they said there was not
hing they could
do for me and that I
would have to use the comment form on their website.
I have never felt so degraded by a fast food organization in my life.
Not only did I not get my food, but I spent the rest of the night
cleaning pizza off of my neighbor's Camaro. Previously I ordered from

dominos several times a year, but I am certain that unless some STRONG
action is taken, I will never eat there again. I am also informing
the members of my congregation about t
his grievous injustices
perpetrated against me by
dominos, and we will unite against t
his
racist treatment of a poor old black man who only wanted to eat some
pizza.

There's one t
hing


you should know about me. I'm a black belt in masturbation. I've jerked my gerkin so much over the past 12 years or so, that my grip is now legendary. I once crushed a man's hand just by giving
him a handshake. Every time he uses that hand now, he t
hinks of me, the man who crippled
his hand. And


you, sword in hand, want to challenge me? I can break that sword in half in 3 seconds. You can try, if


you want to. But just know that I can ruin


your life with one swift motion. Well, what's it gonna be punk?

I smoked the pot once. I went absolutely bats
hit crazy! I couldn't believe it! I found myself driving 2 miles over the speed limit completely safe in my lane to the ne

arest McDonalds... After ordering my Big Mac, large fries and large Chocolate shake. I safely returned home. I watched some Southpark, ate some amazing munc
hies, laughed my ass off and slept like a baby....
I woke up the next morning covered in blood and realized my McDs run had been a bad dream. I actually was driving 100 miles an hour. Jumped a curb and killed two homeless people. I proceeded to toss them in my trunk. Brought them home. Chopped them up and ate em... Damn I really went crazy! I'll never smoke the pot again! It's the devils lettuce!

Just walked outside in my boxer briefs (tight as frick hugging my gluteus maximus and catering to my package nicely), and the
hispanic milf across the street was outside getting groceries out of her car and looked across the street at my physique (I'm 3 weeks into my cut and my striations

are starting to become more app

arent and I'm looking real FREAKING joocy), and she just st

ared for a second because she's never really seen how I look because I always leave the house wearing hoo
dies or sweaters because I
don't really like to show off my body that much (my body is a temple and


you have to earn


your rights to look at the treasure if


you know what I mean), and she just blurts out "NICE A*, YOU LONG DCKD MOTHERFCKER, WHY DON'T YOU COME ON OVER FOR SOME MILFSOUP?". I honestly didn't know how to react, and I had just eaten pop tarts and drank a lot of water, so I just threw up everywhere, tried to run inside and my boxers got caught on a branch sticking out of a bush and ripped them off and then I fell on the ground and started crying. I'm still laying outside on the ground naked because I'm embarrassed to get up. What should I
do?

I was only 16 years old. I loved communism so much, I had all the treatises and propaganda posters. I prayed to Marx every night to thank
him for the dialectical materialism I had been given. "Workers of the world unite," I said, "


you have not
hing to lose but


your chains." My boss hears me, and calls me a tankie. I knew he was jealous of my commitment to the revolution. I called
him a reactionary fascist. He slaps me and sends me to work for a wage. I'm crying now, and I'm alienated from my labor. I lay in my bed, and I'm poor. A warmth is moving towards me. I feel somet
hing touch me. It's Karl Marx. I am so happy. He w
hispers in my ear, "Let the ruling classes tremble at a communist revolution." He grabs me with
his powerful hands and places me on my knees. I am ready. I organize a labor union for Karl Marx. He throws reactionaries into the gulag. It hurts so much, but I
do it for Marx. I take up arms against the bourgeoisie. I want to contribute to the revolution. He roars a mighty roar as he fills my life with class consciousness. My boss walks in. Karl looks
him straight in the eye and says, "From each according to
his abilities, to each according to
his needs." Marx leaves through the win
dow. Workers of the world unite;


you have not
hing to lose but


your chains.

Strolling through college campus unaccompanied as I often
do. Not worried about being harassed or raped because I am a man. See group of


young la
dies struggling to set up a folding table. Two strong women have extended the legs and

are trying to flip the table upright. I approach them uninvited and say hello. One flees, triggered. "let me help with that girls" I easily flip the table upright with... my masculine strength. Now upright, I can see the sign taped to the table top. FEMINIST BAKESALE. I give a low-pitched chuckle with my testosterone privileged vocal cords. "So


you girls have been busy in the kitchen, what did


you bake?" One strong woman stands with a box to rest on the table. Her eyes

are welled with tears at the oppression she is suffering. "C-cupcakes" - "I love cupcakes, let me see what


you have there" I reach my phallic hand over and open the virginal box t
his poor woman is holding. My male gaze objectifies the cupcakes. "Oh those look good. How much?" Another strong woman speaks up, images of Susan B Anthony flash in her head. "They're a
dollar for men because of the corrupt patria--" I stop her short in a textbook case of verbal rape. "That sounds fine. Give me the whole box." I pull out a capitalist paper bill with the image of a Cis W
hite Male Slaveowner on it. The strong woman before me w
himpers in psyc
hic pain as I hand the bill to her, she has been reduced to a slave -- nay -- a commodity. "Thank


you" she says meekly, feeling violated. I give a sensual grunt as I bite into one of the sweet, moist cupcakes. "Mmmm... It was my privilege."

T
his turns my stomach. Just flat out the most offensive game I've ever seen. I can name family members that
died in t
his conflict, wept at the pictures and accounts of the dead and maimed that experienced t
his hell, was taught all the horrors of it from primary school, through my whole life, it's only ever been a symbol of the folly of war, the worst, most black and shameful era of British and European
history. I've been to the actual battlefields and mass graves across Europe, held the minutes silence without fail every rememberence day my entire life, for as long as I could understand the meaning of it. There was no glory in t
his war. No thrilling action or daring
do, no heroes and villains, t
his was mass murder, a scar on the
history of our species, and every single person involved in it was a victim. T
his trailer, the entire concept of t
his game, makes me feel physically sick, and just so fucking angry. How fucking d

are anyone make a game like t
his about the First World War. I
don't know what's worse, the sick fucking emotionless, greedy cunts that would seriously exploit t
his horror of an industrialised massacre, or the ignorant, soulless bastards that will give them money and enjoy it. Anyone involved in t
his, or seriously t
hink of buying t
his, should be ashamed of themselves.

More than 100 stealth egg attacks baffle one Euclid homeowner and police (photos and video) EUCLID, O
hio -- An 85-year-old Euclid man's home has become the target of mysterious egging attacks that began in March 2014 and haven't stopped. The continuous onslaught of eggs has baffled police, neighbors and local government officials who have tried and failed to identify the source of the attacks that have ruined the man's home and kept
his family on edge. "The accuracy is phenomenal," Albert Clemens, Sr. said. "Because almost every time when it's nice weather and they launch five or six of these at a time, they almost invariably
hit the front
door." Clemens green two-story house sits on the corner of Wilmore Avenue and East 210th Street. He and
his wife bought the home as newlyweds about 60 years ago. Though
his wife has since passed away, Clemens still lives there with
his 49-year-old daughter and 51-year-old son. The house has been pelted with eggs several times a week -- sometimes more than once a day -- for the past year. The attacks always happen after dark and last around 10 minutes each. The family has been awoken as late as 2 a.m. by what sounds like the crack of a gunshot against the aluminum siding or front
door. Clemens and police believe the eggs

are being launched from a block or two away. The siding on the front of Clemens' home is destroyed, splattered with dried egg residue that stripped off the paint. Other than a few rogue eggs that
hit nearby homes, no other neighbors have been targeted. "Somebody is deeply, deeply angry at somebody in that household for some reason," Euclid Lt. Mitch Houser said. Winter offered a short respite for the family, as the egging became less frequent during the cold weather. But both Clemens and police anticipate the attacks picking back up as the snow and ice thaw. An unsolved mystery Euclid police have not taken the investigation lightly. They've spent a year
doing undercover stakeouts, canvassing the neighborhood and even sending eggshells for testing. The department's entire community policing unit was dedicated to tracking
down the eggers at one point. Officers respond quickly to every egging call at the home -- w
hich is less than a mile from the police station. Both Clemens and detectives

are at a dead end when it comes to suspects. Clemens had suspicions about a


young man across the street who confronted
him a couple years ago and asked
him to stop calling police about suspicious activity in the neighborhood. Clemens said that he had started calling police more often as he noticed more crime -- mostly suspected drug activity. Another neighbor Clemens suspected was ruled out when officers saw
him standing outside as an attack occurred in the presence of police. Investigators have taken several different approaches to nabbing the eggers, including installing a surveillance camera on the house. Detectives even collected some eggshell samples and tested them in a crime lab. The eggs were traced back to a local Amish farm, but the trail ended there. Clemens says the culprits either have access to a large supply of eggs or

are stealing them from businesses that throw them out when they go bad. Detectives have followed t
his thread, visiting local restaurants and businesses asking about missing eggs. They've also tried collecting fingerprints from eggshells, but Houser said that's an impossible task. When an egg breaks, it releases proteins that destroy DNA. Officers have gone
door to
door questioning neighbors and handing out fliers. Nobody has come forward with any tips. "The person or people who

are
doing it have remained very tight-lipped app

arently," Houser said. "I would imagine it would be hard to keep a secret of somet
hing that had been
done hundreds of times and for nobody to step forward to talk about it." The guilty parties
don't appear to be intimidated by police interest in the case. An officer last year was taking a report when a barrage of eggs was launched at the house. One
hit
him in the foot. Houser said he's never seen t
his level of vandalism in
his 20 years of police work. It's frustrated the whole department, w
hich has dedicated hundreds of hours toward solving the egging mystery. "The man hours put into that investigation were huge and one of the reasons it's so frustrating that we
don't have somebody right now that we can criminally charge," Houser said. The culprits will face charges of felony vandalism and criminal damaging, Houser said. Additional charges could be tacked on if investigators find evidence that the attacks

are a hate crime. The search continues Clemens is waiting until the perpetrators

are caught before he repairs the tarnished siding. His insurance company is refusing to settle a claim until the guilty party is found. He said he used to clean up after each attack, but it became so frequent that he couldn't keep up. Police initially offered a $500 reward for information, but bumped it up to $1,000 after nobody came forward. That money is still up for grabs. "We're not going to let it go," Houser said. "We'll continue to put effort into it until we figure somet
hing out." Despite all the torment, Clemens said he'd never consider moving from
his beloved home. "I like the neighborhood," Clemens said. "I like the city of Euclid. I would live and
die in t
his house -- but it's been kind of a nightm

are."

Hello, everyone! T
his is the LONGEST TEXT EVER! I was inspired by the various other "longest texts ever" on the internet, and I wanted to make my own. So here it is! T
his is going to be a WORLD RECORD! T
his is actually my t
hird attempt at
doing t
his. The first time, I didn't save it. The second time, the Neocities editor crashed. Now I'm writing t
his in Notepad, then copying it into the Neocities editor instead of typing it directly in the Neocities editor to avoid cras
hing. It sucks that my past two attempts

are gone now. Those actually got pretty long. Not the longest, but still pretty long. I hope t
his one won't get lost somehow. Anyways, let's talk about WAFFLES! I like waffles. Waffles

are cool. Waffles is a funny word. There's a Teen Titans Go episode called "Waffles" where the word "Waffles" is said a hundred-somet
hing times. It's pretty annoying. There's also a Teen Titans Go episode about Pig Latin. Don't know what Pig Latin is? It's a language where


you take all the consonants before the first vowel, move them to the end, and add '-ay' to the end. If the word begins with a vowel,


you just add '-way' to the end. For example, "Waffles" becomes "Afflesway". I've been speaking Pig Latin fluently since the fourth grade, so it surprised me when I saw the episode for the first time. I speak Pig Latin with my sister sometimes. It's pretty fun. I like speaking it in public so that everyone around us gets confused. That's never actually happened before, but if it ever
does, 'twill be pretty funny. By the way, "'twill" is a word I invented recently, and it's a contraction of "it will". I really hope it gains popularity in the near future, because "'twill" is WAY more fun than saying "it'll". "It'll" is too boring. Nobody likes boring.

T
his is nowhere near being the longest text ever, but eventually it will be! I might still be writing t
his a decade later, who knows? But right now, it's not very long. But I'll just keep writing until it is the longest! Have


you ever heard the song "Dau Dau" by Awesome Scampis? It's an amazing song. Look it up on YouTube! I play that song all the time around my sister! It drives her crazy, and I love it. Another way I like driving my sister crazy is by speaking my own made up language to her. She hates the languages I make! The only language that we both speak besides English is Pig Latin. I t
hink


you already knew that. Whatever. I t
hink I'm gonna go for now. Bye! Hi, I'm back now. I'm gonna contribute more to t
his soon-to-be giant wall of text. I just realised I have a giant stuffed frog on my bed. I forgot
his name. I'm pretty sure it was somet
hing stupid though. I t
hink it was "FROG" in Morse Code or somet
hing. Morse Code is cool. I know a bit of it, but I'm not very good at it. I'm also not very good at French. I b

arely know anyt
hing in French, and my pronunciation probably sucks. But I'm learning it, at least. I'm also learning Esperanto. It's t
his language that was made up by some guy a long time ago to be the "universal language". A lot of people speak it. I am such a language nerd. Half of t
his text is probably gonna be about languages. But hey, as long as it's long! Ha, get it? As LONG as it's LONG? I'm so funny, right? No, I'm not. I should probably get some sleep. Goodnight! Hello, I'm back again. I basically have only two interests nowadays: languages and furries. What? Oh, sorry, I thought


you knew I was a furry. Haha, oops.

. Anyway, yeah, I'm a furry, but since I'm a


young furry, I can't really
do as much as I would like to
do in the fan
dom. When I'm older, I would like to have a fursuit, go to furry conventions, all that stuff. But for now I can only dream of that. Sorry


you had to deal with me talking about furries, but I'm honestly very desperate for t
his to be the longest text ever. Last night I was watc
hing not
hing but fursuit unboxings. I t
hink I need help. T
his one time, me and my mom were going to go to a furry Christmas party, but we didn't end up going because of the fact that there was alcohol on the premises, and that she didn't wanna have to be a mom dragging her son through a crowd of furries. Both of those reasons were understandable. Okay, hopefully I won't have to talk about furries anymore. I
don't c

are if


you're a furry reading t
his right now, I just
don't wanna have to torture everyone else. I will no longer say the F word throughout the rest of t
his entire text. Of course, by the F word, I mean the one that I just used six times, not the one that


you're probably t
hinking of w
hich I have not used throughout t
his entire text. I just realised that next year will be 2020. That's crazy! It just feels so futuristic! It's also crazy that the 2010s decade is almost over. That decade brought be a lot of memories. In fact, it brought be almost all of my memories. It'll be sad to see it go. I'm gonna work on a series of video lessons for Toki Pona. I'll expain what Toki Pona is after I come back. Bye! I'm back now, and I decided not to
do it on Toki Pona, since many other people have
done Toki Pona video lessons already. I decided to
do it on Viesa, my English code.

. Now, I shall explain what Toki Pona is. Toki Pona is a minimalist constructed language that has only ~120 words! That means


you can learn it very quickly. I reccomend


you learn it! It's pretty fun and easy! Anyway, yeah, I might finish my video about Viesa later. But for now, I'm gonna add more to t
his giant wall of text, because I want it to be the longest! It would be pretty cool to have a world record for the longest text ever. Not sure how famous I'll get from it, but it'll be cool nonetheless. Nonetheless. That's an interesting word. It's a combination of three entire words. That's pretty neat. Also, remember when I said that I said the F word six times throughout t
his text? I actually messed up there. I actually said it ten times (including the plural form). I'm such a liar! I struggled to spell the word "liar" there. I tried spelling it "lyer", then "lier". Then I remembered that it's "liar".

. At least I'm better at spelling than my sister. She's


younger than me, so I guess it's understandable. "Understandable" is a pretty long word. Hey, I wonder what the most common word I've used so far in t
his text is. I checked, and appearantly it's "I", with 59 uses! The word "I" makes up 5% of the words t
his text! I would've thought "the" would be the most common, but "the" is only the second most used word, with 43 uses. "It" is the t
hird most common, followed by "a" and "to". Congrats to those five words! If


you're wondering what the least common word is, well, it's actually a tie between a bunch of words that

are only used once, and I
don't wanna have to list them all here. Remember when I talked about waffles near the beginning of t
his text? Well, I just put some waffles in the toaster, and I got reminded of the very beginnings of t
his longest text ever. Okay, that was literally yesterday, but I
don't c

are. You can't see me right now, but I'm typing with my nose! Okay, I was not able to type the exclamation point with just my nose. I had to use my finger. But still, I typed all of that sentence with my nose! I'm not typing with my nose right now, because it takes too long, and I wanna get t
his text as long as possible quickly. I'm gonna take a break for now! Bye! Hi, I'm back again. My sister is beside me, watc
hing me write in t
his endless wall of text.

. My sister has a new t
hing where she just says the word "poop" nonstop. I
don't really like it. She also eats her own boogers. I'm not joking. She's gross like that. Also, remember when I said I put waffles in the toaster? Well, I forgot about those and I only ate them just now. Now my sister is just saying ran
dom numbers. Now she's saying that they're not ran
dom, they're the numbers being displayed on the microwave. Still, I
don't know why she's
doing that. Now she's making annoying clicking noises. Now she's saying that she's gonna watch Friends on three different devices. Why!?!?! Hi its me
his sister. I'd like to say that all of that is not true. Max wants to make
his own video but i wont let
him because i need my phone for my alarm.POOP POOP POOP POOP LOL IM FUNNY. kjnbh
hisdn
hidfhdfhjsdjksdnjhdfhdfghdfghdfbhdfbcbhnidjsduhchyduhyduhdhcduhduhdcdhcdhjdnjdnhjsdjxnj Hey, I'm back

k. Sorry about my sister. I had to seize control of the LTE from her because she was
doing keymash. Keymash is just effortless. She just went back to school. She comes home from school for her lunch break. I t
hink I'm gonna go again. Bye! Hello, I'm back. Let's comp

are LTE's. T
his one is only 8593 characters long so far. Kenneth Iman's LTE is 21425 characters long. The Flaming-C
hicken LTE (the original) is a whopping 203941 characters long! I t
hink I'll be able to surpass Kenneth Iman's not long from now. But my goal is to surpass the Flaming-C
hicken LTE. Actually, I just figured out that there's an LTE longer than the Flaming-C
hicken LTE. It's Hermnerps LTE, w
hich is only slightly longer than the Flaming-C
hicken LTE, at 230634 characters. My goal is to surpass THAT. Then I'll be the world record holder, I t
hink. But I'll still be writing t
his even after I ac
hieve the world record, of course. One time, I printed an entire copy of the Bee Movie script for no reason. I heard someone else say they had three copies of the Bee Movie script in their backpack, and I got inspired. But I only made one copy because I didn't want to waste THAT much paper. I still wasted quite a bit of paper, though. Now I wanna see how t
his LTE comp

ares to the Bee Movie script. Okay, I checked, and the Bee Movie script is 50753 characters long. Not as long as some of the LTEs I mentioned, but still longer than mine and Kenneth Iman's combined. T
his LTE is getting close to 10000 characters! That means it'll be half the length of Kenneth Iman's LTE. That's pretty exciting. Also, going back to the topic of the Bee Movie Script, I tried to write the entire t
hing out by hand once. But I never finished it, especially since I'm focusing on t
his t
hing now. Maybe I should write t
his LTE out by hand. Nah, I
don't t
hink I will. Yay, we're at 10000 characters! Let's celebrate by talking about MUSIC! Music is cool. That concludes our celebratory discussion about music. Thank


you, and have a good rest

Hi, I'm back now, and I got a book! It's a dictionary for a language called Elefen. It's like Esperanto, but better. Now I can learn Elefen even without internet! That's pretty cool. I will now write somet
hing in Elefen. See if


you can understand it! Here goes: Si tu pote leje esta, tu es merveliosa! Elefen es un lingua multe fresca! Did


you understand that? Maybe


you can't speak Elefen, but


you still understood that because of


your knowledge of other languages. Elefen is cool because it's an actual language, not an English code like Pig Latin or Viesa. Oh, I forgot to mention that my sister is back from school. She's blasting Rhett and Link songs right now. Have


you seen that picture of Rhett and Link standing with a bunch of ***? Sorry, I almost said the F word there. That would've broken my rule of not saying the F word. I wrote somet
hing in Elefen, so I will also write somet
hing in Toki Pona. See if


you can understand it now! sina sona e toki mi la sina pona mute a! I can speak Toki Pona fluently, by the way. It's also a pretty cool language. My sister is still playing annoying songs. It's
hindering my focus right now. But it's fiiiiine. Okay, luckily she's run out of songs to play. At least for now. She's trying to t
hink of another annoying song to play. Now she's playing a song by Green Day. Not NEARLY as bad as the other songs she just played. I should go for now. Goodbye! Hello, I'm back

You swine. You vulgar little maggot. You worthless bag of filth. As they say in Texas. I’ll bet


you couldn’t pour !@#$ out of a boot with instructions on the heel. You

are a canker. A sore that won’t go away. I would rather kiss a lawyer than be seen with


you.
You’re a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You

are a spineless little worm deserving not
hing but the profoundest contempt. You

are a jerk, a cad, a weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You

are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.
You

are a bleating foal, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf sme

ared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying


your alleged birth into t
his world. An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody, aban
doned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired


you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had
done.
I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as


you. You

are a monster, an ogre, a malformation. I barf at the very thought of


you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid


you. You

are vile, worthless, less than not
hing. You

are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of t
his earth. And did I mention


you smell?
Try to edit


your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with


your insight. The evidence that


you

are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly.
You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick


you up, drive its beak into


your brain, and upon finding it rancid set


you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of


your ignoble blood. May


you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of


your own trite, foolish beliefs.
You

are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You

are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You

are foul and disgusting. You’re a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look
down on


you. Even sheep won’t have sex with


you. You

are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.
And what meaning
do


you expect


your delusional self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us? What fantasy
do


you hold that


you would believe that


your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake?
You

are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You

are ridiculous and obnoxious. You

are the moral[size] equivalent of a leech. You

are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You

are sour and senile. You

are a disease,


you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meat slapper.
On a good day


you’re a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You

are deficient
in all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You

are dank and filthy. You

are asinine and benighted. You

are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever


you go.
You smarmy lager lout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock. You grotty wanking oink artless base-court apple-john. You clouted boggish foot-licking twit. You dankish clack-dish plonker. You gormless crook-pated tosser. You churlish boil-brained clotpole ponce. You cockered bum-bailey poofter. You craven dewberry pisshead cockup pratting naff. You gob-kissing gleeking flap-mouthed coxcomb. You dread-bolted
fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill.
You

are a fiend and a coward, and


you have bad breath. You

are degenerate,
noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing


you exist. I despise everyt
hing about


you, and I wish


you would go away.
I cannot believe how incredibly stupid


you

are. I mean rock-hard stupid.
Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You

are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid.
You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Not
hing in our universe can really be t
his stupid. Perhaps t
his is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anyt
hing else as to be beyond
the laws of physics that we know. I’m sorry. I can’t go on. T
his is an epiphany of stupid for me. After t
his,


you may not hear from me again for a w
hile. I
don’t have enough strength left to deride


your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of t
his drivel. Duh.
The only t
hing worse than


your logic is


your manners. I have snipped away most of what


you wrote, because, well... it didn’t really say anyt
hing. Your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective... Maybe later in life, after


you have learned to read, write, spell, and count,


you will have more success.
True, these

are rudimentary skills that many of us ”normal” people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there

are ”challenged” persons in t
his world who find these t
hings more difficult. If I had known that t
his was


your case then I would have never read


your post. It just wouldn’t have been ”right”.
Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish


you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on


you.

Once taken place in a terribly dreadful time, there was a small cat-licking bird that lived on a not-so-big lane by my house whose name was Charles just like every other soul, male or female, that lived on my smelly, stinky, orange , old, rotten, messy, busted cul-de-sac between Belmont and Rose which
are both awfully gay Streets Like North street or some shit that reminds me of a celebrity like Paris Hilton or some blonde loser that
doesn't even know the capital of her own country, which is the United States of America aka: The U.S.A which is a pristine nation of beauty, opposing to a country as the country of Somalia and Belgium, a part of Europe, which
doesn't even have a government, it's just in a complete state of anarchy just like my mind and soul which
are both filled with outrageous nonsense that I'm typing
down right now into some fat long sentence that probably makes no sense but who c
ares I'm trying to set some sort of weird record here like most ducks snorted or some weird thing like that and if I
do set some sort of record I will be in the Guinness Book of chimkin nungets World Records (though anti-American and pro-European, a place of pitty and despair as Somalia is) which was always my dream because that book has a whole bunch a cool and weird stuff in it and I would Become famous and add to the weirdness of the book like some of their records which reminds me of the Rob & Big where Rob sets all of those skateboarding Records And Big Black eats bananas and
donuts and three weeks later they both get plaques saying the record they set and I want to get one of those so that's why I'm writing all of this stuff
down without ever using a period or some other sentence ending mark like an exclamation point or a question mark or any other symbol that could possibly end my streak of words that is really long now and would take me a while to count just like counting sheep which is supposed to put

you to sleep but it really keeps

you awake because

you want to keep counting and counting until

you
don't know what comes after trillions, but that would take Years or something because it would take a while just to count a trillion seconds or minutes would be even worse just like how ducks
are worse that geese because they
are more aggressive around their

young unlike great white sharks which
are often eaten by their mothers when they
are born and the ones who
do make it out alive have no mother to teach them how to hunt or whatever because none of that matters because us human beings have mothers unless they die or run off with some CEO of a big company or someone else who makes a lot of money and then they leave

you with

your dad and

you
are jealous of

your friends if

you have any because they have moms and

you
don't because

your mom was some greedy pig who wanted money but ended up only getting the money part and she bought drugs because she was depressed and ended up killing herself from an over
dose and

you wouldn't even know about it until

you become some rich person and check the files somewhere and learn that she died of a over
dose and

you eyes get all teary and then

you start crying because

you know that

you wouldn't be alive without that woman

you called mom and I just found out right now that the longest sentence is like 10,000 words so I have a ways to go and

you have to go with me so let's go to 6th gear and throw out some words like Emphysema which I had to
do a report on in 4th grade because we had a ton of projects and this was the disease one and we chose diseases out of a hat and I came out with Emphysema which is a form of lung cancer which is 98% caused by smoking which reminds me of the way my dad describes smoking: "

you get plant leaves, wrap them in paper, light it on fire and suck on it" which is normally a sentence but not today because I'm setting out on the quest for a long sentence that I'm typing up which reminds me of a story my grandpa told me about himself when he was "

your age" about how they covered the letters on the type writers and they had to type so that they could memorize where the letters
are on a type writer and my grandpa says he will never regret taking that class because it helped him out a lot when it came to typing and now a days he is not bad a typing at all because He is almost as fast as me because I am a pretty fast typer and writing this article isn't taking very long and expect being pretty far pretty soon at the pace I'm going right now so there
are going to be some serious records getting busted when I'm finally finished writing this article on this dumb website which will probably end up huffing this article even though it is fun-packed and joyful and keeps the reader reading when they use that excuse to mom saying "just one more sentence" but that sentence is 10,000 words long and still continuing to go at a reasonable pace and it is going to shatter most of those long sentence records just like how the chargers
are going to shatter the most consecutive years without a super bowl win record and I
doubt that they will win one in the near future but they patriots
are going to win some serious super bowls because they
are the best team ever even better than the cowboys or 49ers and no one c
ares a bout them so go patriots and boo chargers even though I live in San Diego and Like the Padres I hate the Chargers because they
are bad and the padres
are bad too but I
don't c
are because they
are my favorite team and the
dodgers
are my least favorite along with the Yankees because the Yankees get a lot of money to spend and the padres and marlins get almost nothing and then the Yankees buy a-rod for a lot and the Rays get almost no money but
are still fighting for first place this season without expensive players like Derek Jeter or a-rod or Johnny Damon or whoever because they
are an all around better team that can beat the Yankees even though the Yankees can beat the royals a lot who really suck because they suck more that the padres
do and so
do the mariners and Rockies even thought the Rockies went to the world series last year they lost and haven't stopped losing for a while now, either and they
are last place in the NL west and that is where the padres used to be but they started hitting home runs and winning games and
are
dong pretty good right now despite having little offense except for Adrian Gonzalez who is leading the NL in RBI's even though he is on the team who scores the least runs in the league but they
are not last in homeruns though they
are like 5 away or something but I’m not sure so screw that and let's talk about something fun like water or food or dirt or something but I think food is the best because their is a lot of things to talk about with food like

you r favorite food which mine happens to be some spicy burrito form Chipotle mexican grill and it is very good just like this macaroni my mom made one time that had bread crumbs on top and it was very good like all of the food they serve on top chef which I wish I could be a judge for because they have a lot of good food on that show and it makes my mouth water whenever I watch it and that is why I watch it because the food is totally awesome and sometimes I hate the people but they end up getting eliminated like the Dance crews in France's Best Dance Crew which is a great show and

you should watch it because people
do good dancing like the JFrabbawockeez because they won the first season and they
are very good just like supreme soul and So real crew and phresh select and super cr3w and I’m only at 1500 words right now so I have to write some serious stuff like a life biography about myself and anything I’ve ever
done which includes going to big bear to ski, fishing, breathing, swimming, going, farting, eating, sleeping and a whole lot more stuff which reminds me of 4th grade again when my teacher was debating with the class whether "a lot" was one or two words and all of the kids including myself said one while the teacher said two and he was right and we were wrong but no one c
ared because we all had fun arguing about and I have fun arguing with my friends about football and not baseball because in baseball we all like the same team but in football I like the patriots and my friends like the chargers and the 49ers and the eagles and the saints but my team always woops their team's ass and they say that the patriots "cheat" and that's how they won even though the patriots just pwned their team and they suck and my team is good but we all agree when it comes to baseball because we all like the padres and we never really argue over anything in baseball which is my favorite sport and I play it and I am good a it and I want it to be my profession but I
doubt that that will happen so my backup plan is being a cop because

you get all of the benefits and

you get paid after

you retire which is good news and I would also like to be some government dude or something like that because they get the benefits too so it would be cool to work for the government which reminds me that my principal worked at the white house and taught the president email because he was the computer guy or something like that so h knows a whole bunch of computer crap like my dad and he is fat too so everyone makes fun of him and I think he huffs kittens too but I am not sure and about that and what the hell is up with all the noob and kitten huffing on this gay ass website like all of the things like "the writer may have been huffing kittens" and stuff like that it really annoys the hell out of me just like other things such as when people clip their finger nails it makes that weird noise that get me all crazy and I hate it just like how me friend hates the sound of chalk on a chalkboard which I find soothing and relaxing but he gets really annoyed and psyched out and he is also very pale-skinned and so is the rest of his family so it must have been some genetic thing like twins and clones and whole bunch of other confusing science crap that I learned a long time ago in 7th grade or something which was when we watched movies in class like UHF which has "Weird Al" Yankovic in it and it is very funny because "Weird Al" Yankovic has to save a TV station with a whole bunch of weird shows like wheel of fish and rauls wild king
dom with a whole bunch of cool animals like flamingos and turtles and stuff like that but who c
ares lets get to the meaty part of this article which is the part where I write the longest word known to man which is Methionylthreonylthreonyl...isoleucine which is cut out because it has 189,819 words so Wikipedia had to cut out the middle part and the longest word is the name of a protein which is the largest known to man to so big names go to big things is app
arently the moral of this story ladies and gentleman the road
doesn't stop here and I have to continue no matter what

you say or think so I should just write some story now that has no periods so lets start with a guy named Carl who liked fish and women and he went to Clara’s house and they had a good food but that isn't enough of a story to set the record so I think I’ll just stick to writing ran
dom crap which really makes no sense at all and here is some ran
dom picture that shows a guy who has two legs and another guy who has three who is mocking the guy with two legs because he rips his flesh in disgust every night and

you think about who would be dumb enough to rip their flesh instead of cut the ring off or something that
doesn't involve entirely gruesome crap like that and I have another life after this one just like how cats have 9 lives I have three because I’m on my second one right now and it is great and

you might think I’m a whole new person but

you
are thinking wrong it's just when I died I came back t life and next time I die I’ll come back to life again and then when I die I’ll be dead for sure which reminds me of Stephen king's book called pet sematary which is coo because people come back to life because there was a burial ground that bring people back to life if they
are dead and that book is a great book and

you should read it along with the Harry Potter series which has magic in it and it is cool too so
don't shank

yourself when

you
are cutting that meat for dinner or

you might die of massive blood loss or might just need a band aid I mean that works too or

you
don't even need a band aid because I
don't use them and I have never gotten and infection in my life so maybe I’m lucky or have an alligator immune system or something but I
don't use band aids and I
don't use Neosporin on my cuts so I’m some sort of miracle I guess but I’m wasting twenty minutes of my miracle life on this retard article that I just want the Guinness book of world records to see and go that is the longest thing ever and have me in their book so I’m striving towards that goal right now and I’m not stopping until I hit at least 3000 words and then I’ll
do the construction thing and finish thing up tomorrow or sometime after now and I will be the author of the longest single sentence on the planet earth which will be a real accomplishment on my part so

you can be real jealous right now because I am making history right in front of

you and if

you
are still reading this I am truly impressed because this article must be getting really boring by now and maybe

your not even reading this just scanning the article for periods which I’m afraid

you will not find until the very end of this article which is a very, very, long way away and if

you
are a slow reader well sucks for

you but now I have to use that construction thing and I will finish this and now I am back after a hard day at work but I’m still going now so get ready to rumble with this long thing called a sentence that is as long as Mt. Everest is tall and the Marinas Trench is deep and speaking of the ocean fish of all kinds live in the ocean such as puffer fish which
are poisonous to eat if not prep
ared right and will make

you die after and

you ADMINS BETTER NOT DELETE THIS BECAUSE IT IS SOME RECORD and if

you
do delete it well I will have this saved and what will

you
do then

you people who will want to delete this because

you
don't c
are about people trying to break records so
don't delete this or I will boycott Uncyclopedia and will be very mad at

you guys like how I am Mad at Tim for being so annoying just like Celebrities and loud people and people who
don't brush their teeth which makes me think of killing myself except I wouldn't
do that because I am some sort of miracle as

you probably read before or not because

you
are tired of reading this jumble of words that
are still making a grammatically correct sentence that is breaking records right now and I won't stop until

you let me break some serious records like longest sentence and some other weird stuff that I might get an award for or something but I also want that Guinness record plaque that

you get for setting a monster record like most consecutive noses picked with boogers in them or something completely obscure like that which is like a bunch of the articles on this website which
are actually some times funny like how to solve a one by one by one Rubik’s cube which made me laugh pretty good and the star wars one is good too so never delete those two because they
are funny unlike this article because this article is more boring than funny but who c
ares some retard might laugh at this bundle of crap and I think that I will put that crap tag on this article so people know that this article isn't really funny but that it is long and boring like Dances with Wolves and some other long movies that

you actually fall asleep during which is hard for me to
do so I tend not to nut I did when I watched Dances with Wolves because it was really boring like counting sheep to a trillion or some other large number that some little kid says he wishes he had that many
dollars but he will never get that many
dollars because there isn't even that many in circulation right now and if there was that would be some major inflation right there so
don't think

you can get that much money kid because then

you would not be
doing this country a favor which it desperately needs I might add so instead burn money instead of make it and lower inflation rates and
do everyone a favor except for the people who
are already really rich and
don't c
are about inflation and would rather drive an escalade instead of a Prius in ti
aremes like this with all of the gas prices and stuff that would drive up

your bill but they
don't notice because they have a lot of money and
don't c
are therefore they should die and burn in hell with all of the lawyers and other bad people on this ball we call earth that really isn't a perfect sphere because of the mountains and valleys makes it look all jagged but from space it looks like a sphere but looks may be deceiving so
don't think that the world is a sphere no matter what other people say and tell them to eat themselves when they try to convince

you that the earth is really a sphere but it isn't just like how most ignorant people think that Columbus found America but he really didn't that was Leif Erickson, but Columbus really found the Bahamas thinking they were penis outside of china and he was wrong so everyone forget Columbus and remember some other sailor like Henry Hudson who tried to find the northern passage but didn't so his crew killed him but a he was a great man any way so remember him instead of Columbus or remember William Penn who created Pennsylvania or remember

your grandma or someone but not Columbus so go ahead and think that the earth is flat even though it isn't and it can have for corners if

you think about it so go die and fall off a cliff or something interesting like that or at least get a life that want’ to penis e a cool record like the one I'm setting right now so go to a pawnshop and buy a life or kill

yourself and get a new one or something weird like that or I will force

you to and if

you
are still reading this

you
are an amazing human because I forget most of the stuff I’ve written already except for the great white shark thing at the beginning of the article and I remember that I need to go see some good movies tomorrow or sometime in the near future like within a week or something but forget that I'm only at 3500 words now so lets go to 4000 penis and then maybe I’ll call it quits because this is boring and I would rather write another article that is good and long but not all one sentence like this one so let's come up with some final five hundred words or so to say before I stop writing all of the nonsense so let's brainstorm ideas like poo, ducks, lemons, flanges, more ducks and star wars which sound about like enough and I like star wars out of there so let's talk about some penis star wars stuff like Kit Fisto who has weird tentacle things on his head and Ki-Adi-Mundi who has two brains and is on the Jedi which is penis honor and privilege because it is and Kit Fisto gets killed by Palpatine in the 3rd movie like Mace Windu who is cool and I like his light saber because it is purple unlike the standard blue and green colors which I prefer green out of but most people seem to like the blue colors but who c
ares about them they like blue and green is better so

you better not like blue or

you
are some lame person that will be lame for the rest of

your life like some people who think that they
are cool but
are really posers and they live their life not knowing that they
are continually mocked and made fun of all of the time behind their backs and that they
are really dumb or something so go out and tell all of the posers

you know to not be posers anymore and tell them that they should go jump in a lake or something insulting like that and make them run and cry and

you can laugh at them and hope they
don't tell their mom who will be mad at

you so maybe

you shouldn't even
do that

you should just laugh at them behind their backs while they live the poser life and I'm near 4000 words now so let me slow
down now yeah I have about a hundred words left so let me write
down the exact amount before I stop writing so let me finish this thing up by talking about
donuts and their fried goodness and how they make

you fat and stuff but they
do taste good so

you should eat them because they
are good and they taste good even though

you could get fat but no one c
ares so eat them and be happy and I am starting to near 4000 now so just be a bit patient and this has been fun guys so let me finish right about, where

you should wait for it, and wait, 'till right about, where we
are almost there, having just two more for that

you should wait, while this actually isn’t going to stop because I want this to keep going for a little while longer so that I can still break some record but man am I tired so I think I will actually shut up now, nope this has to continue forever and will continue for years and then a Bert killed the 3-legged guy and ate his orange while pooping and then I shall say the bird's name is "a bird who walked across the street killed a guy with a Minecraft nose and stuff. Jesus Christ is my lord and savior.You guys probably think that that is the worlds longest sentence, but it's not,because I just keep on adding commas, and it's pretty easy, if

you think about it, so anyway there is this girl at school and she's my friend, and all but she's turning really mean, its a different person, and I'm trying to beat the record, but that girl, who likes this boy, who likes this girl, and who likes this other boy, and that same kid likes this other girl, but that girl like another guy, but the guy is actually a 40 year old man that eats penis for a living for the ability to never show the meerkats who's
doing the write things oh and my last remark is that socialism
does not work because look at Europe and Greece which is failing miserably; America always wins, there is no
doubt about America's beauty, Amen and I just made it longer, and longer still as I continue to talk and talk and talk and talk throughout this, though I believe it would be referred to more as typing, so I will continue to type and type and type and type and type until I grow bored of it, and I have so I will take my leave soon, but not before I say that I somehow managed to make this already super long sentence longer, so HALLELUJAH, but we
are not
done yet everything I just said IS NOT RELEVANT to daily life, if

you read this all

you have no life, did u mention I like waffles and pancakes and people and gay marriage. This is a hell of a sentence peeps. What ever the man did the child would not wake up from the bullet that entered his head and he woke up again to find himself in heaven and then he felt fire and it was hot very hot very hot very hot very hot very hot but then he said "so" and he was alive again, alive, alive, alive, alive and then he flew like a bird and he looked in the mirror and saw his wings and his beak and his legs he was a bird like wow like what like wow like what that's so cool but then a dragon came and saved the bird and turned him into a princess and he had to live with the dragons and it was so boring and like who wrote this, who has the time to
do this, because I obviously
don't, and many other people
don't, such as the president, CEO's of companies, terrorists, workers, kids, p
arents, adults, and many other people, but who even gives a fuck about what we're
doing, because this is all bullshit. yeet yeet ass haircut goobly gooobly spongebob asspants

We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so
do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell
you how I'm feeling
Gotta make
you understand
Never gonna give
you up
Never gonna let
you
down
Never gonna run around and desert
you
Never gonna make
you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt
you
We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but
You're too shy to say it
Inside, we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

And I want to say this to the kings in the audience. I’ve made my mistakes in my chase for coochie. But in all of my years of chad life, I have never simped– never simped for a girl. I’ve earned every bit of cooch. And in all of my years of chad life, I have never paid for the meal. Because people have got to know whether or not I’m a simp. Well, I’m not a simp. I’ve never simped for any girl I’ve got. I am not a simp.

please
do not
swear i
dont like
swearing
swearing isnt good because god
does not like it
please
dont
do it and by it i mean
swear because as i stated previously it is not a very christian thing to
do and if
youre jewish or something i
dont care just
dont
swear my parents check my phone and if they saw a
swear word they would make my hiney red because they would spank it over and over and over and over and over and over and as i was saying
dont
swear because my parents will see the
swear word lingering on my ipod 3G in the
youtube app because thats what i
do i run a
youtube channel on
youtube and make
swear-free videos for all the
swear-free video enthusiasts out there who like to watch my videos of me not
swearing staring at walls with no
swear words written on them so what im trying to say is
dont
swear because if
you
do there will be a no
swear video with a no
swear wall but a yes
swear comment section which will break the chain of non-
swearing-ness which is what i a
dore so
please
do not
swear within the
youtube app on my channel because god
doesnt like it he can see
you when
youre sleeping and he knows when
youre awake he knows if
youve been bad or good so be good for goodness sake oh You better watch out
you better not cry better not pout im telling
you why santa claus is coming to town with little tin horns and little toy drums rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums and i forgot the rest but see i copied and pasted that for
you so
you wouldnt
swear aww isnt that sweet of me yes it is because i enjoy not
swearing i love
you
